     Advance the Foundations of A Subject
    </h3>
    <p>
     Our knowledge of the logical and natural foundations of many field is
slight, or at least dubious or imperfect. Certainly
     <u>
      subjects differ
drastically in the
     </u>
     relative strength of their foundations, or in the
apparent
     <u>
      fundamentality of their
     </u>
     concepts, methods, principles,
theories, achievements, research, language, logic, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
     <u>
      Ideonomy can compare the foundations of different disciplines to
discover
     </u>
     analogies, differences, commonalities, interdependences, contradictions,
redundancies, interpenetrations, convergences, common goals and needs,
unities, etc.
     <u>
      It can use these to suggest
     </u>
     omissions, errors, common
opportunities for research or discovery, ways to redescribe the foundations
of one subject in terms of the foundations of another, reciprocal problems
and fallacies, equivalent principles and entities, joint ignorance, new
tests and experiments, higher standards, useful priorities, strategies
of theory, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
     It can suggest ways in which to combine or transform certain concepts
or dimensions so as to generate or define 'all' possible or important concepts
or things, or the spaces and manifolds thereof. Contained or implicit within
such sets, spaces, and manifolds may be concepts or other things that can
supplement or deepen the foundations of the subject to which they pertain.
    </p>
    <p>
     Moreover, examining or merely experiencing such enlarged perspectives
upon what is possible may lead to the realization that what has been taken
to be fundamental within a subject is not really fundamental; or at least,
that the foundations--or supposed foundations--of the subject are not as
free of assumptions, problems, inelegant features, superfluous elements,
discrepancies, idiosyncratic aspects, etc as has been thought.
    </p>
    <p>
     Since ideonomy seeks to discover all of those natural concepts, dimensions,
representations, entities, phenomena, laws, principles, relationships,
etc that are
     <u>
      supremely
     </u>
     universal, fundamental, important, essential,
minimal, logical, generative, necessary, transcendental, and pantological,
it is in a privileged position to advance the foundations of arbitrary
fields.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is in fact a principal goal of ideonomy to make all sciences more
scientific, and among the best ways of doing this are by rectifying, enlarging,
and extending the foundations of these subjects.
    </p>
    <p>
     There is a hint that ideonomy may be on the verge of discovering some
unsuspected category of being that is more fundamental than either ideas
or things, or that transcends what is meant by both the "mental" and "physical''
aspects of reality.
    </p>
    <p>
     By placing all of the things and phenomena in a subject upon basic scales--as
of duration, time, Population, importance, complexity, or entropy--ideonomy
can call the mind's attention to what is only naturally the most and least
fundamental in a subject, to the way in which things derive their greater
or lesser fundamentality from one another, to the direction in which that
which is truly or most fundamental is apt to be found, or to the properties
that fundamentals or foundations are likely to or must have.
    </p>
    <p>
     Knowledge or theory of the foundations of many subjects is impaired
by a conscious or unconscious failure to identify, define, characterize,
or emphasize the most fundamental, central, or final topic, concept, phenomenon,
substance, law, entity, goal, or the like of the subject (or the set of
such things). Then again, the supreme topic or whatever may have some terrible
unsolved problem or difficulty associated with it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Thus the supreme concern of physics is no longer clear, the arch concern
of sociology is in dispute, the goal of psychology is in flux, the essential
nature or defining properties of life are unknown to the science of life
(or to biology), and even the basic object of study of mathematics (it
cannot be
     <u>
      number
     </u>
     , though the nature of number is an enigma in any
case), cosmology (what is the described or effable 'universe'
     <u>
      itself
     </u>
     a part of?), and ideonomy (
     <u>
      ideas
     </u>
     , as hinted above, may not be sufficiently
fundamental) is mysterious.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ideonomy can be used to define concepts in new and ever more fundamental
ways, and it has already been used to define life, or to reduce it to a
set of ninety-two fundamental properties. The set of 8,464 possible dyadic
combinations of the primary properties have demonstrated such extraordinary
interest that they promise to revolutionize theoretical biology, something
which at once illustrates the importance of clarifying fundamentals and
suggests that the traits that were used to define the phenomenon of "life"
were indeed fundamental.
    </p>
    <p>
     On the other hand, the same bit of ideonomic research also highlighted
the problems that plague all efforts to resolve fundamentals or to get
at the genuine foundations of a subject; for it was found that the same
set of ninety-two basic properties of "life" have either analogs or exact
equivalents in the supposedly inanimate phenomena of subjects other than
biology. Thus forms or analogs of procreation, natural selection, and evolution
either may or do exist in fields such as physical chemistry, geology, psychology,
and cosmology. The implication may variously be that life is not limited
or peculiar to biology, that life must be otherwise defined or defined
via other properties, that the essential phenomena of biology should include
more than organisms, or that biology should be recast into a superscience
incorporating many other sciences or that--like mathematics--applies to
all science.
    </p>
    <p>
     An old way of advancing the foundations of a subject is by improving,
formalizing, or axiomatizing its logic; and a new or just now emerging
way, by giving the subject cognitive form, which means the form of thought
itself. Ideonomy can help with both of these approaches, particularly in
conjunction with computer software and hardware.

       Erect Frameworks For Thought
      </font>
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     To think about anything one needs some manner of conceptual framework,
a schema upon which to hang ideas or in which to develop, interweave, and
experiment upon different concepts.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ideonomy, in effect, can enable such conceptual schemes, structures,
and systems to be mass produced; it can widen their scope, diversify them,
enhance their power, increase their connectivity or interrelatedness, greaten
their mobility within and between fields, enlarge their rationality or
make their logic more explicit, give the individual the power to freely
manipulate them, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
     The concept of
     <u>
      mental frameworks
     </u>
     is so important to ideonomy
that it needs to be expanded upon. By it we mean an open-ended set of
     <u>
      :
schemes, structures, systems, and 'machines' of
     </u>
     : ideas, relations,
principles, presuppositions, facts, arguments, thoughts, beliefs, values,
purposes, perspectives, methods, strategies, gestalts, analyses, attitudes,
percepts, images, definitions, explanations, dimensions, symbols, criteria,
representations, models, heuristics, postulates, generalizations, theories,
procedures, wisdoms, stories, memories, analogies, rules, mental associations,
etc :
     <u>
      serving or for furthering thought.
     </u>
    </p>
    <p>
     <u>
      Such mental schematizations of
     </u>
     : experience, the environment,
reality, behavior, human existence, or possibility :
     <u>
      can be
     </u>
     : conscious
or unconscious : formal or informal : specific, general, or universal
     <i>
      ad
hoc
     </i>
     or perpetual (evolutionary) : deductive or inductive : empirical
or theoretical : categorical or experimental : developing or inert : etc.
    </p>
    <p>
     <u>
      The diverse values and uses of cognitive frameworks include
     </u>
     :
mental simplification; clustering, grouping, and classifying of ideas and
facts; explication and coordination of different purposes and goals; structuring
of memories in hierarchies, series, networks, trees, vergences, rings or
cycles, foliations, meta-stories, etc-that are especially dynamic, powerful,
natural, efficient, dense, optimal, etc; recursive, self-developing, nucleative,
and self-correcting properties or effects; the multidimensional mental
parallax given by a multitude-of such frameworks; provision of a stable
apparatus for developing and maintaining mental skills; standardization
within the mind (
     <i>
      à la
     </i>
     worldwide industrial and scientific
standardization); provision of bases for tests, evaluations, investigations,
and experiments; limitation of thought to what is necessary and obviation
of trivial and repetitive thought and creativity; bases for communication
among different minds and for comparisons of their contents; enabling of
more precise and rigorous thought; codification of though! acceleration
of thought; enabling of overviews of experience, the world, one's conduct,
and the mind; greater mental flexibility and self-control; readier learning;
quick or more powerful structuring of materials, subjects, problems, or
situations; automation of mental habits and of ideation; heightened clarity
of mind; etc.
    </p>
    <p>
     Frameworks for thought can enable a topic to be taught, mastered, or
treated more deeply or completely. They can provide clues for probing the
nature of a thing. They can enable more imaginative or less prejudiced
thought. They can help one to prepare for a more serious intellectual endeavor.
They can help one relate one perspective to another, or permit one to grasp
a new thing by analogy to an old or familiar thing.

     those needs and wants; one could help to
     <u>
      educate
     </u>
     all present and future humanity to deal with the future; one could attempt
to
     <u>
      influence
     </u>
     the actual course the world will take tomorrow, or
to push it toward what would be good and away from what would be evil or
inferior; one could labor to produce general
     <u>
      methods
     </u>
     for foreseeing
or altering the future; etc.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course the future being referred to need not be that of the world
as a whole or represented by the future in its entirety, but on the contrary
might be arbitrarily modest: one's own future lifetime, perhaps, or tomorrow's
events or the events of the next minute, or the momentary or instantaneous
outcome of a scientific experiment that someone is performing or whose
performance is simply being contemplated.
    </p>
    <p>
     Becoming wiser about the future might mean nothing more than divesting
oneself of prejudicial ideas, attitudes, beliefs, or world views, becoming
friendlier--or more hostile--to innovation, reducing the irrational inertia
of institutions, or paying more attention to the patterns and lessons of
history that might be analogous or relevant to the future.
    </p>
    <p>
     <u>
      Among the fallacies that diminish wisdom about the future, and that
ideonomy could help to combat, are that
     </u>
     : the future will simply repeat
the past; the course of the future is predetermined and inalterable; the
world of the present represents the best of all possible worlds; human
knowledge and wisdom are nearly complete and perfect--and our ignorance
small and unimportant; the future is too complex or esoteric for us to
anticipate its character or possibilities--and past failures and inability
to correctly foresee the future were unavoidable, and should be looked
upon as a warning that all prophecy is folly; etc.
    </p>
    <p>
     <u>
      Ideonomy could be used to
     </u>
     : devise new, or suggest all possible,
methods for studying future possibilities; survey, describe, compare, evaluate,
criticize, correct, extend, integrate, and transcend
     <u>
      all past and present
     </u>
     prophetic methods, endeavors, and results; identify the totality of things
that can or should have their future possibilities considered; predict
the future interrelationships and interactions of these things; indicate
the future's
     <u>
      most fundamental
     </u>
     dimensions, structure, forces, elements,
patterns, laws, etc; formulate principles for treating the future; develop
novel means for representing and dramatizing the future's possibilities
(e.g. diagrams, organons, computer software and simulations new types of
books, special language and idea spaces, artificial intelligence programs,
etc); suggest all possible causes, effects, and conditions of future possibilities;
rank the relative and absolute probability and importance of all future
possibilities; indicate the different roles and functions that things are
apt to have in the future; and so forth.
    </p>
    <p>
     <u>
      Some of the specific questions and other issues that ideonomy could
help to address are
     </u>
     : What should be maximized and minimized in the
future? What new rights may become political issues in the future? What
human freedoms must ultimately be restrained for the good of all? What
present concerns of government will be retired and what new concerns will
take their place? What means are there for maximizing the future diversity
and complexity of civilization? What were the laws of history, insofar
as they apply to the future as well? How ambiguous is the future or are
its possibilities? What meta-structures are applicable to the study of
the future or will actually describe its possibilities: incl. chains, series,
trees, networks, hierarchies, vergences, etc? What elements of the present
will disappear or endure in the future? What new discoveries, inventions,
creations, and other innovations are possible, probable, or certain in
the future? What developments can continue
     <i>
      ad infinitum
     </i>
     and which
must have limits? In what ways is the future apt to surprise us? What are
all the future possibilities of a single, random or particular, thing?
What future possibilities would be synergistic or antagonistic? In what
order must different things happen?

    <p>

     One can use ideonomy to help to generalize or even universalize any
and all notions and things.
    </p>
    <p>
     Over time things often prove to be insufficiently generalized. That
is, the essential idea or set of ideas associated with them turn out to
have greater meaning, scope, or application than what is initially --or
perhaps than is ever at any finite moment--thought to be the case.
    </p>
    <p>
     Actually it is probably true that in some sense the generality of all
concepts, and all concepts of things, must always be at once inadequate
and excessive.
    </p>
    <p>
     But according to an ideonomic principle it is of the utmost importance
that the generality of all concepts constantly be enlarged over time, or
advanced toward infinity. Naturally in the course of such progressive generalization
the concepts will undergo fundamental metamorphoses, yet a form of semantic
continuity may be apparent in retrospect that was prospectively invisible
or even meaningless.
    </p>
    <p>
     It could be said that all concepts are inherently infinite in meaning,
and even that this infinite aspect is close to their essence.
    </p>
    <p>
     To generalize - according to the dictionary - is to make general reduce
to general laws : give a general form to; to derive or induce (a general
conception or principle) from particulars; to derive or induce a general
conception, principle, or inference from; to make general (as by existential
or universal qualification) : render applicable to a wider class; to give
general applicability to; to modify or eliminate (nonessential details)
for emphasizing some particular feature; to portray or emphasize general
rather than particular features and characteristics of.

     </u>
     :
Historically, the generalization of the legal concept of a
     <u>
      person
     </u>
     to include corporations and other organizations, even though these contain
many human beings;
     <u>
      Energy
     </u>
     has been generalized to include mass;
Some quantum physicists would generalize the concept of a
     <u>
      physical phenomenon
     </u>
     to include the apparatus used to measure the phenomenon, the observer,
or even the observational or mensurational act; A few physicists would
go even further, and define any
     <u>
      phenomenon
     </u>
     as perforce including
the whole universe or all of spacetime; Certain modern composers generalize
the notion of
     <u>
      musical scale
     </u>
     to include any systematic or recurrent
arrangement of notes on which a composition is based; The concept of
     <u>
      intelligence
     </u>
     has been generalized to include animals that were formerly regarded as
mindless;
     <u>
      Skeletal and muscular systems

include the cytoskeleton and other purely intracellular systems and structures;
Analogous generalization of the
     <u>
      nervous system
     </u>
     to include equivalents
in unicellular organisms--and perhaps plants--may be imminent; Concepts
of
     <u>
      star and galaxy
     </u>
     should perhaps be generalized to include one
another--since stars (as superstars) may equal or exceed (dwarf) galaxies
in size; The progressive generalization of the concept of number in the
history of mathematics to ever more abstract, strange ' numerous, and 'less
number-like' things (imaginary numbers being one of the more famous products
of this process); Over history the concept of
     <u>
      evolution
     </u>
     has become
ever more generalized--to embrace not only biology (life; the phylogeny
of species, ontogeny of bionts, and life-long biosynthesis of molecules,
organelles, etc) but geology (Earth and other planets; the evolution of
continents, mountains, geospheres, etc), astronomy (stars, galaxies perhaps,
and the universe as a whole), physics (matter, energy, space, time, physical
laws and constants perhaps, etc), society, industry, economies, the mind,
ethics, the arts, etc;
     <u>
      Mental illness
     </u>
     has been generalized to include
normal mental states and individuals (on the belief that the difference
is only one of degree, perspective, or concern)--and
     <u>
      mental normality
     </u>
     has been generalized to include mental illness (e.g. based on the belief
that the latter may be rational, coherent, or productive when viewed internally,
from a different or larger perspective, or with an awareness that society
is universally illogical and insane);

     successions
and combinations of

that may be generalized in the future:

    <p>
     <u>
      Humor
     </u>
     : If precursors, rudiments', theriomorphic variants, or
analogs of laughter or a risibles are eventually found in animals other
than man, generalization of the concept or phenomenon of humor (its origin,
functions, mechanisms, types, properties, referents, states, logics, degrees,
scope, etc) may turn out to be desirable or necessary;
    </p>
    <p>
     <u>
      Machine
     </u>
     : The concept of a machine may have to be generalized
so as to include biological phenomena (e.g. genomes, protein molecules,
micelles, organelles, cells, organs, biochemical networks and processes,
bodily macro- systems such as the nervous and immune systems, organisms,
ecosystems, and the hypothetically Gaian bios), various phenomena and entities
in pure and applied mathematics--or even logic, chemical reactions, crystals,
diversely intelligent computers; models, simulations, and even scientific
theories; human languages and computer programs; geological and meteorological
phenomena such as volcanoes and storms, the 'universe', man's mind or society,
pure or real-world ideas, physical laws, statistical and quantum phenomena
in physics, economic systems, political ideologies, ethical systems, and
symphonies;
    </p>
    <p>
     <u>
      Food
     </u>
     : This should include 'nutritive' atmospheric gases; conceivably
organisms get some genes or genic influences directly from food (via "lateral
gene flow"); the body is forever 'consuming itself' (in strange and little-
known senses); even inanimate phenomena 'eat' or require 'nutrition' from
their environment; conceivably the seemingly stable and self-existent macroscopic
world, with its delomorphic baryons and leptons, is in reality being dynamically
maintained and replenished from below, or by chains, fountains, singularities,
plexiform or vergent hierarchies, or the like ascending from the ultramicroscopic
level of zero-point, Bore], Dirac- vacuum, Wheeler-prespace, or Bohm-implicate
order fluctuations; and the mind 'eats' ideas;
    </p>
    <p>
     <u>
      House
     </u>
     : This concept should be generalized to include the diverse
homes (-nests, burrows, cavities, interstices, webs, mounds, hollow trees,
logs, host exteriors and interiors, atmospheric dust and cloud particles,
etc) of all organisms; shells, exoskeletons, skin, bodies, the skull and
blood-brain barrier, etc; cells, plasmalemmas, misc. membranes, etc; ecological
niches, ecosystems, and the bios; as well as the 'houses' of inanimate
phenomena: atmospheres, planets, the heliosphere, the galactic atmosphere,
the universe, factories, etc;
    </p>
    <p>
     <u>
      Universe
     </u>
     : Generalizing this terribly presumptuous concept might
be appropriate if there are other universes or quasi-external parts of
our universe, Everett's Many-Worlds Cosmology is real, most of the mass
of the universe is invisible and exotic stuff, there is an infinite microcosm,
Bohm's Implicate Order exists, etc; or to take account of Wheeler's Superspace,
the omniverse (all of spacetime), physicomental "reality", and the Ideocosm.

Failure to make adequate or correct provision or preparation; Inability
to notice and rectify a faulty course; Taking of excessive or unnecessary
risks, perhaps unconsciously; Blindness to opportunities; Indecision and
inaction in crises; Indirection and aimless wandering; Lack of plans and

resources; Anarchy; Distractibility; Inaction; Anomie and tedium; Lack
of motivation; Inconsistencies, contradictions, and disharmonies; Impossibility
of cooperative endeavor; Inability to structure existence; Fragility of
an enterprise and a tendency for it to degenerate and fragment; Inability
to discriminate good from bad--or to recognize what is best and worst,
vital and unimportant, central and peripheral, significant and irrelevant,
etc; Anonymity to the world at large or external confusion and misreaction;
Etc.
    </p>
    <p>
     <u>
      Ideonomy can be used to suggest goals that are
     </u>
     : new, alternative,
contrasting, successional or progressive, maximal or optimal, safe, certain,
transcendent or revolutionary, unconsidered or overlooked, realistic, easy,
expedient, productive, ultimate or supreme, simpler or more complex, indirect,
contingent, secondary or tertiary, suited to oneself, complementary to
situations or circumstances, compatible, synergistic, logical, less costly,
multidimensional or multipurpose, subtle, definable, proportionate to one's
resources, unorthodox, contra-intuitive, irredundant, finite or infinite,
equivalent or analogous, specific or general, universal, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
     Goals are often pursued that are the wrong ones, but they are not abandoned
because they have never been made explicit. When some goal is made explicit
it becomes possible to study its real meaning and importance and the relationships
it has to other things that are being done or that might be done. The things
that are required for the goal to be achieved can be investigated, decided
upon, and implemented.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ideonomy by its nature encourages the comparative study of every sort
of goal in every sort of field, and profitable knowledge can be derived
from this of the larger and more efficient ways and means of pursuing arbitrary
or all goals. Mistakes that are apt to be made in selecting and achieving
goals can be identified, along with ways of avoiding those mistakes or
of dealing with them when they occur.
    </p>
    <p>
     <u>
      Other characteristic problems that are associated with the pursuit
of goals include
     </u>
     an overdramatization of the importance of a single
goal, token attention to the goal, a tendency for a goal to be misformulated
or misinterpreted, failure to appreciate that a goal is apt to be more
than a simple name or definition and may embrace the simple insights that
are apt to accrue in planning for and advancing toward the goal, the error
of relying upon a single method or path for achieving the goal, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
     <u>
      Illustrative examples of goals are
     </u>
     : Putting the first men on
the Moon; Target in an enemy country of an intercontinental ballistic missile;
Downing and eating of a gazelle as the goal of a lion that is stalking
it; Student's goal of passing an exam; Finding a needle in a haystack;
Landing someone as one's spouse; Solving some great unsolved problem in
mathematics, as by finding a proof of Fermat's last theorem; Breaking an
Olympic record in poll vaulting; 'Pineapple's goal' of reaching the standard
size specified by the genome of the pineapple plant; Zinc atoms' 'goal'
to deposit themselves on the cathode in the electrolysis of zinc chloride
solution; Break-even point in research to achieve controlled thermonuclear
fusion for industry; 'Goal' of a column of magma ascending through Earth's
crust to reach the atmosphere and erupt lava on the Earth's surface; Goal
of a company to recover its investment in developing a new product; Puppy's
goal of reaching its mother's teat while fighting its littermates for the
same objective; Goal of a detective to discover the identity of a murderer;
'Goal' of the disturbed surface of a pond to settle back into hydrostatic
(gravitational) equilibrium; Etc.
    </p>
    <p>
     Although the concept of a goal in the realm of inanimate nature is momentarily
discountenanced, several fundamental questions are in fact begged by this
exclusion, and--certainly with revision--the concept may one day be be
resurrected. At the very least it may be decided that the
     <u>
      word
     </u>
     should
be redefined so that it can function in this more embracive way, since
dead matter can be observed to behave in ways that
     <u>
      by analogy
     </u>
     suggest
the pursuit and satisfaction of goals by organisms or minds. The 'goal'
may simply be the thermodynamic end-state of a physical process that is
relaxing toward equilibrium-regardless of whether that end-state is known,
specifiable, or even meaningful in advance, or of whether it is uniquely
implicit in some set of mathematical equations. It is also true that it
is premature to absolutely exclude the possibility of teleological phenomena
or of "final causes" from physical nature. Excluded possibilities in science
have a funny way of reentering the picture years later in radically different
dress, although this is a lesson that scientists have been slow to learn.

     It is possible to know, or even to prove, that a goal is attainable
while at the same time remaining ignorant of how to actually achieve it.
Even if all of the necessary resources and methods are at one's disposal,
a critical sequence of steps or concatenation of things may elude one.
An objective may hover an instant, layer, cell, operation, or decision
away and yet be impossible to reach simply because the path to it is not
known, well-defined, or available.

    </p>
    <p>
     To clarify good it may be convenient, desirable, or necessary to first
or eventually consult, define, investigate, portray, or even create bad.
Bads and goods are both primary concerns of ideonomy.
    </p>
    <p>
     <u>
      Basic classes of goods are
     </u>
     : Helps and assistance; 'Net goods';
Virtues; Excellences; Benefits; Advantages; Ideals; Wishes and aims (desired
things and conditions); Needed and useful resources; Good luck; Pleasures
and pleasurable things; and 'Non-bads' (absences of bad; everything that
is not actually bad).
    </p>
    <p>
     The goods that interest ideonomy need not have anything to do with human
beings or human values. Inanimate phenomena and entities--and 'pure ideas',
whatever
     <u>
      they
     </u>
     are--have their own agathokakological orders.
     <u>
      All
     </u>
     goods of
     <u>
      all
     </u>
     things should be inquired into, systematized, and reduced
to ever more universal laws.
    </p>
    <p>
     How can good be served, maximized, and evolved if we are ignorant of
its kinds, possibilities, and laws? If we do not understand its complexities,
problems, contradictions, and illusions? If its elements, fundamentals,
needs, mechanisms, processes, and manifold relationships to the other things
of the universe are unknown?
    </p>
    <p>
     One way to begin the scientific study of good would be to examine the
nature, circumstances, and existence of a single-random or particular-thing
in an effort to discover all goods of or connected with the thing, or every
way and degree in which any or every thing is or is not 'good' for the
thing or 'from the thing's perspective'.
    </p>
    <p>
     Were the thing to be given such comprehensive agathological scrutiny
an ant, for example, one might ask and try to answer these questions: Is
the presence of a minimum amount of water in the soil important to the
ant's hive? Which traces of chemical elements are good for the ant's diet,
     <u>
      even though they are not essential nutrients
     </u>
     ? Are there diseases
of other soil organisms that benefit the ant when they occur? What polymorphisms
are good or best for the species of ant? What wind velocity at the mouth
of an ant's nest is optimal for the colony, in good weather? Are there
certain early life experiences that are good for an ant to have, say because
they trigger the emergence of latent instincts, orient the ant for life
to the peculiarities of its environment, or institute certain skills in
the then- plastic nervous system of the ant?
    </p>
    <p>
     Lessons here could be carried over experimentally to the possible goods
for other animal species. Discrepancies, adaptations, and supplementations
noted through such series, networks, and hierarchies of comparisons could
lead to an even more powerful generalization of agathological knowledge,
methods, and skills, and eventually make possible the treatment of arbitrary
goods of arbitrary things.
    </p>
    <p>
     Another valuable ideonomic exercise would be to construct a diagram
with the names of a random set of related or maximally diverse things scattered
about but enclosed in ellipses. Arrows would be drawn between certain ellipses
to indicate which things are or might be, in some sense or degree, good
for which other things.
     <u>
      Arrows could be
     </u>
     : one-way or two-way, simple
or branched, connected only to ellipses or also referent to or from other
arrows (
     <i>
      à la
     </i>
     vergences, networks, circuitries, hierarchies,
or other meta- structures), weighted by being thickened, colored to signify
senses of good or goodness, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
     <u>
      Complementary sets or suites of the diagram could be created to exhibit
or investigate
     </u>
     the difference that various arguments, circumstances,
or perspectives make for the possible or actual relationships, incremental
but rational and natural changes in various directions (e.g. that of scaled
time or probability), how different people would render the same diagram,
etc.
    </p>
    <p>
     Such an agathological diagram - or agathogram - could be programmed
on a computer in a matric or dynamic form. Multivariate analysis, multidimensional
scaling, cluster analysis, artificial intelligence techniques and programs,
etc could be used to discover and explore an agathological universe - or
agathocosm - of : meaningful, contrasting, interdependent, orthogonal,
nonexistent, evolutionary, anamorphic, circular, cyclic, autopoietic, mathematically
diverse, arborescent, stochastic, chaotic, aesthetically appealing, "implicate"
(in David Bohm's sense), etc : idea spaces, permutations, combinations,
clusters, chains, series, "rotations", inversions, representations, games,
systems of motions and transformations, morphogeneses, other types of ideograms,

fallacy; it may be a fallacy that there is only one way to solve certain
problems or answer certain questions--and ideonomy may have a peculiar
power to bring to light the actual richness of possibilities; One of the
spurs for the creation of ideonomy in the first place was the attempt to
furnish the human mind with some universally more powerful instrument in
the treatment of extreme difficulty and complexity, and in the handling
of the special problems being created by the explosive growth of human
knowledge, technology, and endeavor; Unexpected analogies may exist between
the hardest things in different sciences, the concepts and methods pertinent
thereto, the importances thereof, and even the basic solutions to the problems
represented by such things--analogies that ideonomy can help to reveal
and treat; Ideonomy can be used to ascertain and dramatize the absolute
and relative need, importance, and consequences of achieving the hardest
things; Ideonomy can systematize, coordinate, accelerate, and maximize
the imagination and discovery of the totality of hardest things; Usually
few people know of the existence, nature, and implications of the hardest
things, and ideonomy can make such knowledge more broadly available, both

hierarchies may well exist in and as nature, and all things, in some sense,
may be hierarchical or possess hierarchical aspects, elements, and relationships.
    </p>
    <p>
     The foreseen task is to find and define the totality of such hierarchies
and hierarchical relationships, to identify the laws thereof, and to progressively
exploit the opportunities implicit in such things.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course hierarchy represents
     <u>
      just one
     </u>
     of the basic genera of
so-called meta-structures that presumably pervade the universe or 'reality',
but the exemplifications, meanings, and possibilities of each such genus
must be thoroughly investigated and elaborated. The case of hierarchy can
serve as a general example of what must be done and of what is apt to follow
upon the doing of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     What is meant by the word or concept of hierarchy? One way to answer
this question is by seeing what hierarchy could mean--or what hierarchies
may in fact, or could in theory, exist--in connection with a variety of
things. For example:
    </p>
    <p>
     <u>
      Could there be a hierarchy of snowflakes
     </u>
     ? Actually there could
be many such hierarchies: Presumably there is a probability spectrum for
different flake shapes; Formative mechanisms may be plural or subject to
complication or external influences, in which case either the causes or
their effects may canonically progress in chains and branch in--chronological
or nomological-- trees; Probability or existence of certain flake forms
may be a function of the set-theoretic statistics or combinatorial clustering
of other flake forms; Etc.
    </p>
    <p>
     <u>
      A hierarchy of winters
     </u>
     ? Perhaps winters can be multidimensionally
described and there are certain types of winters that are only likely to
to occur after, or somewhere in the middle of, certain sequences of other
types of winters; Perhaps there is a hierarchy of descriptions or of descriptive
elements, such that certain descriptions or elements are more fundamental
or at least simpler than others, and it is appropriate or necessary to
'move along' the hierarchy in attempting to characterize winters; Etc.
    </p>
    <p>
     <u>
      A hierarchy of stars
     </u>
     ? Certain stars generate chemical elements
and isotopes that are then recycled in other stars and without which those
other types and generations of stars are impossible; Similar stellar hierarchy
may exist thanks to the production, recycling, multistage transformation,
or control of different molecular species by generations--or perhaps by
synchronic hierarchies--of stars; Hierarchical sets of stars may create
different physical conditions at a variety of levels (e.g. of stellar density)
that induce special types of stars, or of stellar behavior, at those levels;
Etc.
    </p>
    <p>
     <u>

or of their contents include

    <p>
     <u>
      Possible effects, values, or uses of hierarchies include:
     </u>
     Arbitrarily
large sets of things or elements can be connected, reduced, related, or
traced back to, or derived from, just a single thing, element:, point,
event, law, etc.--via a path that is at once
     <u>
      maximally
     </u>
     short, powerful,
comprehensive, logical, necessary, central, self-similar, ubiquitous, etc;
Causation, perturbation, government, etc can be shown to be, or treated
as being, completely unidirectional and an incremental and comprehensive
flow over an arbitrarily large set of identical or diverse things, processes,
phenomena, domains, effects, changes, events, etc; Time-asymmetric evolution
of an entire system or universe; Flows in two opposite and paired directions
can be enabled or defined--flows of an opposite, complementary, reciprocal,
or independent nature or content; Things or processes of every possible
size, number, or complexity can all be 'reduced' to the dimidiations, doublings,
bifurcations, partitionings, iterations, recursions, fractal structure,
or the like of a single thing, process, pattern, or the like--so that the
smallest and largest scales or sets, first and last things, whole and parts,
e/vc of the hierarchy are mutually derived, antisyzygially, in an exact
or approximate way; Generalization, specialization, and their interdetermination;
Alternative descriptions, classifications, or treatments of things can
be rigorously excluded; Possibilities can be constrained; Different and
disjunct trees of possibilities can be differentiated and selected; Things
can be described or controlled via the simplest language, code, logic,
or information-theoretic structure; Operations or actions can be reduced
to uniquely consecutive and finite decisions; Variables can be treated
as constants, and constants as variables, at successive 'levels'; Those
degrees of freedom that enable the self- organization of a phenomenon or
realm can be increased or maximized; Potential or actual self-interaction,
self-government, self-connection, autocorrelation, self-description, complexity,
heterogeneity, proteanness, e/vc of a thing or phenomenon can be maximized;
Use of resources can be optimized, or need for resources minimized; Redundancy
can be minimized, irredundancy maximized (and vice versa, paradoxically);
Etc.

     Particularly or peculiarly interesting genera of hierarchies in this
list are in upper case. Many suggest fascinating problems, questions, and
possibilities--which ideonomy will eventually address.
    </p>
    <p>
     Actually many things need to be learned about all of those genera.
     <u>
      Thus
what are all of their
     </u>
     : exemplifications, specializations, causes, effects,
roles, interrelations and interactions, laws, activities, structures, transformations,
histories, futures, evolutions and retrogressions, fine structure, etc?
    </p>
    <p>
     Hierarchy can be defined in many different ways.
     <u>
      The dictionary distinguishes
     </u>
     :
(1) The arrangement of objects, elements, or values in a graduated series;
(2) A series of objects, elements, or values so arranged; (3)
     <u>
      In logic,
     </u>
     a series the members of which are grouped in accordance with a principle
(as of importance, perfection, or priority); (4) The stratification so
achieved;
     <u>
      specifically
     </u>
     , a table of statistical correlations having
a constant proportional relationship and graded from high to low; (5) A
body of persons or things ranked in grades, orders, or classes, one above
another; a system or series of terms of successive rank, used in classification
(as in biology).
    </p>
    <p>
     Additionally, of the adjective "hierarchical" it says: (6) Having the
power to control; influential.
    </p>
    <p>
     A more ideonomic characterization of hierarchy: (7) At the top or upward
is the thing or set of things that controls, dominates, influences, limits,
expresses, indicates, facilitates, e/vc the meaning, importance, behavior,
degrees of freedom, changes, possibilities, relationships, aspects, costs,
needs, outputs, e/vc of that below or dot-inward.
