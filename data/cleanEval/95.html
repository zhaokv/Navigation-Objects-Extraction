          November 1944
          <p>
           MY COMRADE AND MY BROTHER:
          </p>
         </font>
         <p>
          <font class="10V" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">
           These are two appellations which are sincere and intended. You are at this time facing
    changes. The choice with which you are confronted is not so much where you will work, but
    whether you have arrived at a high water mark in your developed life of service and can
    therefore go no further, or whether there are still to be found in you those springs of
    interest and those inner urges which will enable you to reach outward and further into the
    life of the spirit. [502] Such is oft the choice with which the disciple is faced who
    reaches close to the three score years and ten of ordinary human enterprise, as you do
    today. The difficulty lies in the fact that, fundamentally, either decision is right. Few,
    however, face the choice consciously or intelligently or, having made it, abide by the
    decision made. From the standpoint of the ordinary aspirant, the choice is relatively
    unimportant because the time equation is of no great moment at this stage; a few years
    more or less are of no import in the eternity of soul reaction. Therefore, a decision to
    relax, to hold the point gained, but to refrain from further struggle, has in it no room
    for criticism. Remember this.
          </font>
         </p>
         <font class="10V" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">
          <p>
           From the
    standpoint of the accepted disciple - such as you are - there may be more to the choice
    than at first appears. It might be of service to you, and to all who may later read these
    instructions, if I dwelt for a moment upon the inevitable problem of the working disciple,
    upon the problem of the man who reaches the age which you have reached. Shall he rest back
    upon his laurels (and you have laurels, my brother, as I pointed out in my last
    instruction to you) or shall he - to use a Biblical phrase - "gird his loins"
    anew and go forward with a fresh impetus and to a still higher summit of attainment? Shall
    he demonstrate the power of the seventh wave which will carry him forward much further
    upon the beach of life expression or will the strong undertow of ordinary human frailty
    pull him back from renewed effort?
          </p>
          <p>
           The reasons why a disciple must at least endeavor not to relax unduly and should push
    on in spite of fatigue (the fatigue of years of living), in spite of the increasing
    "creaking" of the human apparatus and the inevitable tendency which comes from
    constant service and constant contact with others, might be enumerated as follows:
          </p>
          <ol>
           <li>
            He must endeavor to carry the rhythm of service and of fruitful living with him when -
        free of the physical body - he stands upon the other side of the veil. There must be no
        gap in that service.
           </li>
           <li>
            He must endeavor as far as in him lies to preserve the [503] continuity of his
        consciousness as a
            <i>
             working
            </i>
            disciple and should allow no gap to emerge between his
        present point of tension and that point of tension which supervenes after the death
        experience.
           </li>
           <li>
            He must endeavor to close the episode of this life experience so that it is apparent
        that he is a member of an Ashram; he must permit no break in the established relationship,
        or any cessation to the flow of ashramic life through him to the world of men. This
        activity, on account of the natural and normal deterioration of the physical vehicle as it
        grows older, is not so easy a task; it requires a definite concentration of effort, thus
        increasing the tension in which a disciple ever lives.
           </li>
           <li>
            For any disciple in my Ashram, the problem in this time of world crisis is peculiarly
        urgent, and this for the following reasons:
            <ol type="a">
             <li>
              My Ashram is the main affiliated Ashram with that of the Master K.H. To him, my Master
            (as I am yours), is given the task, on a large scale, of world education along new lines.
            Through my Ashram, working under the inspiration of his, the newer, esoteric presentation
            of truth is to be given out. The work that I have already done - through my books and
            through all the teaching which you have attempted to embody - is to render the teaching of
            the other and older esoteric schools and groups entirely exoteric. There is little left to
            them that is new; they must now link up with the sources which I represent if their
            leaders are to present fresh and vital information to their students, or they must take
            what I have conveyed to the world, via A.A.B., and thus again reintegrate into the
            esoteric whole.
             </li>
             <li>
              Disciples in my Ashram have a dual responsibility to stand steady in
              <em>
               a
              </em>
              <i>
               preservation
            of realization -
              </i>
              if I
              <i>
              </i>
              may use such a phrase. This steadiness must not be
            relaxed in any way as old age draws near, and it must not be permitted to disappear
            through the transition of death itself. It is through the [504] unbroken conscious
            thinking of a welded group of disciples that the Master of an Ashram works. It is not so
            much the active outer service of a group of disciples which is of major importance (though
            it has necessarily a vital purpose) as the coherent, integrated group thought which is so
            potent in effecting changes in the human consciousness.
             </li>
             <li>
              The peculiar problem of the present world crisis and the terrific readjustments in the
            human consciousness, incident to the inauguration of a new culture, civilization and world
            religion, warrant my presenting the members of my Ashram (even affiliated groups, such as
            yours) with the opportunity to preserve intact and free from all deterioration their
            "state of mind" throughout the remaining years of this life, through the process
            of dissolution, and on into the freedom of the other side of the veil. This preservation
            of conscious integrity is no easy task; it requires understanding and most deliberate
            effort.
             </li>
            </ol>
           </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
           I call you, therefore, my brother, to exactly this effort. The consequences to you will
    be a much harder life of service from now on; the results will be the carrying out of your
    plans for work with greatly intensified effort.
          </p>
          <p>
           You should now work in closer cooperation with A.A.B. and F.B. The task of carrying
    esoteric truth into Latin and Catholic America and southern Europe is no easy undertaking.
    It will be slow. Your foundation must be well and truly laid. The quality of those reached
    by you in the future is of more importance than the quantity. Bear this ever in mind.
    Relinquish not the various phases of the work you have so successfully launched, but
    proceed with them as heretofore - no matter where may be the place of your physical plane
    enterprise.
          </p>
         </font>
         <p>
          <font class="10V" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">
           One of the many things which you need at this time to learn, and which you must
    initiate during the next few years, is how to gather people together and work through
    them. This, as you have been taught, is very difficult for a first ray disciple to master,
    particularly when the soul ray  [505] and the ray of the astral or emotional nature
    are both first ray. It is easy for the first ray disciple to withdraw into his soul
    consciousness, far easier than for any other ray types, and your problem (as it is also
    the problem of J.W.K-P.) is to give the second ray personality fuller sway, and thus
    balance the first ray ability to demonstrate detachment by the functioning of the opposite
    quality of attachment - so distinctive of the second ray nature. Ponder on this.
          </font>
         </p>
         <font class="10V" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">
          <p>
           As I told
    J.W.K-P. some years ago, a "detached attachment" (paradoxical as it sounds) is
    the goal of the first ray working disciple. This is equally true of you. You and he have
    the same egoic, personality and mental rays. Hence the close link with him which you have
    ever realized. He is a disciple of the Master M., temporarily working in my Ashram. You
    have been admitted into the ranks of accepted disciples in my Ashram and by me, but you
    will eventually be transferred into the Ashram of the Master M. The free interplay thus
    established between my Ashram and that of the Master M. is due to the fact that he is the
    inner Head of all esoteric groups, and in the interest of the coming new world order, the
    teaching Ashrams are being strengthened by the inflow of first ray disciples. This should
    be a point of real interest to you.
          </p>

           What, my brother, shall be the type of meditation and interior work which you should be
    doing during the coming years? I would like to have you meditate upon the "three
    activities": Outward moving, persistent orientation, and interior withdrawing or
    abstraction. The
           <i>
            relation
           </i>
           of these three activities or three attitudes should form
    one aspect of your reflection upon these phrases; the relative activity involved in each
    attained position should constitute another; the effect produced by each of them in the
    three worlds, and also upon soul levels, demands careful and concentrated thought. What,
    for instance, is the nature of "outward moving" upon the astral plane? How would
    "persistent orientation" appear or express itself upon the mental plane? Or
    "abstraction and withdrawal" upon the physical level of consciousness? How can
    you, as a disciple, display these attitudes simultaneously? I think you will admit, my
    brother, that in these three [506] concepts and in their working out in the daily life
    within the ring-pass-not of the three worlds and in the life of the soul upon its own
    plane, I have given you the theme for much thinking during the coming years. Take each of
    these phrases, therefore, and think each of them out in relation to each of the three
    planes in the three worlds, and to each other; carry the same directed thinking on to soul
    levels and shift the theme then into the three worlds of the Spiritual Triad, regarding
    the lower three worlds then as reflections of the higher, triadal three. Keep notes of all
    the thoughts of reality which come to you;. watch the reactions produced in your vehicles
    of expression, and become increasingly aware of the changes which conscious, deliberate
    thinking will bring about in you. Think - if I may so express it - in your heart, and also
    in your mind, and endeavor to comprehend the distinction between these two modes of
    thought.
          </font>
         </p>
         <font class="10V" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" size="2">
          <p>
           This
    reflective work should constitute your meditation work in the future; it will condition
    your interior development and will also inevitably make your outer work more dynamic.
          </p>

           One reason why I have emphasized the need for attachment in this instruction is that
    right attachment releases the love of the soul, and only love, consciously, intelligently
    and deliberately applied, can make for successful work, both in Europe and South America -
    your two recognized fields of service. Only your second ray personality will have the
    capacity to reawaken contact with your students in Spain or hold steady those already
    working in South America; it is through individually refound, reawakened and reinspired
    realization that the work, planned and intended by me, can be successfully carried
    forward. Such is your immediate task. Only your second ray personality can have the
    patience to cover the mass of detail needed and to persist in the face of
           <em>
            appa
           </em>
           r
           <i>
            ent
           </i>
           non-success. Much skill in action will also be required. The Catholic Church is
    governed by the first ray as its soul ray, and by the third ray as its personality ray.
    Hence its love of politics and of temporal power; hence also its intensely commercial and
    financial preoccupations. The mental ray of this Church is sixth ray. Hence its narrow
    one-pointedness: [507] its emotional body is also sixth ray in quality, whilst the
    physical ray of the outer Organization is seventh. These are points which should interest
    you and which you need to bear in mind as you work. A realization of this peculiar
    combination of rays will demand of you, and of all workers along esoteric lines, great
    skill in action.
