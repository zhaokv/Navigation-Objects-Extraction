    pairing and spawning? Many people are totally unaware of this. The courtship of fishes in
    not as complex nor as varied as that of men and women, and the courtship of fishes is not
    complicated by innuendos, hidden meanings and cryptic signals as in Homo sapiens. Rather,
    courtship in fishes, as with birds, mammals and other animals, comprises sets of
    recognisable signals, following set sequences which for fishes, provided the partners are
    physiologically ready, culminate in spawning. Courtship behaviour of fishes might be a
    simple set of signals and answers or it might be very elaborate and complex, depending on
    the type of fish. However, the signals are always easy for potential mates to read.
    Indeed, it is easy for biologists to read and interpret these signals. </p>

    <p align="JUSTIFY">Among the most interesting and best known to aquarists is the elaborate
    courtship of cichlid fishes. Typically a male develops a territory which he defends from
    all intruders. Many species also build nests, which might be elaborate sand castles, or
    excavations with tunnels or burrows, or may simply be a cleaned part of the rocky or sandy
    area in which the territory is held. Once the tasks of developing a territory and building
    a nest are complete the male is ready to invite females to his nest to spawn. Eager males
    may attempt to do this even before the nest is complete, but they are nearly always
    refused as the female does not get all the correct messages if the nest is not there. One
    of the reasons for this is that part of the courtship ritual includes the nest, and each
    nest type is species-specific; it is a characteristic of the species that is important to
    mate recognition and the acceptance of the correct partner.</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="file:///D:/Code/clean_eval/Tony_8_Fish_reproduction.jpg" width="361" height="240" alt="A cichlid mother looking after her young. The cichlid fry are trying to enter her mouth."></p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">The initial invitation is ‘side-shake’ during which the male
    approaches a female, extends his fins and flexes so that the anal fin, which usually has
    attractive spots and colours on it, towards the female. If the female is interested the
    male then turns away and facing the spawning site beats its tail in a movement inviting
    the female to follow (‘follow-shake’). If the female is still interested, then
    with exaggerated, undulating movements the male leads the female to the spawning site
    (lead-swim). Once in the nest or spawning site, the couple circle each other, perform a
    variety of shakes (nest shake, vertical nest shake etc) and gently nudge each other till
    the female lays eggs. The female then picks up the eggs in her mouth, sometimes doing so
    before the male has had time to fertilise them. This would be a waste of eggs, so to solve
    the problem the males of many species have dummy eggs on the anal fin. This fin is spread
    out in front of the female to display the egg dummies and curled slightly to hold
    spermatozoa that he will release. The female tries to pick the egg dummies from the male
    anal fin and in doing so collects spermatozoa, that fertilise the eggs in her mouth. The
    need to collect the eggs before they are fertilised arose from the fact that eggs are
    often stolen almost as soon as they appear by other fishes which feed upon them. Another
    problem is that males that do not have territories, and were not chosen as mates by the
    female, try to sneak spawnings by darting down between the spawning couple and fertilising
    eggs that are exposed. By collecting the eggs promptly, the efforts of robbers and
    sneakers are largely circumvented.</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="file:///D:/Code/clean_eval/tony2.gif" width="591" height="359" alt="The spotted fish are ‘cuckoos’ entering the mouth of the mother of the striped fry."></p>
    <p align="JUSTIFY">Once in the mouth the eggs develop into young fish that remain there
    until they are ready to feed for themselves. Most cichlids will then look after their
    young for sometime (a few days to four or more weeks), taking them into their mouths when
    there is a threat from predators. The fry are also taken into the mouth at night for
    safekeeping. Once the fry are independent they leave the care of the mother. Some cichlids
    behave as cuckoos; they give their fry to another species to care for. It seems that the
    foster parent can recognise the foreign young, but she is unable to chase them away or
    swallow them as both activities will endanger her own brood. Chasing foreign fry that are
    mixed tightly in a school with ones own fry is not possible without chasing away the own
    fry too. Similarly, how does the mother swallow foreign fry and not her own? </p>
