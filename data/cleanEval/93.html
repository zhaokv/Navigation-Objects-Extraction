          <strong>
           I. The Arcane School is a Training School for
    Disciples
          </strong>
          <p>
           At the close of the world war (1914-1945) the Arcane School had been
    in existence for nearly 25 years and had, in that time, serviced over 20,000 people. Its
    curriculum is progressive; step by step the studies deepen and the meditation work becomes
    more intensive as the student passes from one degree to another.
          </p>
          <p>
           No teaching is given at any time in the development of the psychic powers; people are
    not taught to be clairvoyant or clairaudient; no training is given in magic or in the use
    of magical rituals, and nothing is taught at any stage on sex magic. Our whole emphasis is
    laid upon spiritual living, upon the mental grasp of the occult teaching and upon those
    rules and processes which will bring about right relations to one's fellowmen, right
    relation to one's own soul, right relation to the Spiritual Hierarchy (of which the Christ
    is the Supreme Head), and right relation to a Master and His ashram, or group.
          </p>
          <p>
           Because the Arcane School is designed solely to train people to be conscious, working
    disciples, its curriculum is definitely eliminative. The work you are asked to do is not
    easy, nor is it intended to be easy. The standard maintained and desired is high and the
    work is planned in such a way that those whose mental equipment and spiritual aspiration
    are inadequate to the requirements automatically drop out; they find,
           <i>
            for themselves,
           </i>
           that
    they cannot cope with the work. We never encourage people to stay in the work unless they
    show fitness, for they only get discouraged and labor under a sense of failure and this is
    bad for all concerned.

           Discipleship entails a loving heart and a keen, alert mind. The loving heart has always
    been emphasized, plus devotion, by the churches and the esoteric groups. This is a basic
    truth and necessity, but a keen, alert and trained mind is of equal importance. The
    Masters reach the world of men through their disciples; that is the way They choose to
    work. They are seeking, therefore, intelligent, [283] self-controlled men and women - with
    vision and with a self-imposed, spiritual discipline - through whom that work can be
    carried forward. Intentionally, therefore, we make the work difficult and keep the
    standard of requirements high because we, too, are looking for people who can use their
    minds or who show at least
           <i>
            a willingness
           </i>
           to develop and use their mental processes.
    The need of the more emotional and aspirational types and of the devotees can well be met
    in other groups and esoteric schools, and is thus being met.

           Running
    through all the work of the Arcane School is the theme of service. Service to one's
    fellowmen is the hallmark of a disciple and the key also which opens for him the door of
    initiation. Therefore, all who enter the School and face the new cycle of training find us
    saying to them: Study, think and prove to yourself and to us that you have grasped the
    teaching by writing your study papers; learn to meditate and so make a contact with your
    true spiritual Self, the soul, and make service the expression of what you know. These
    three things should be your main spiritual preoccupation during the time spent in the
    earlier degrees. You will find that, as each year slips away, your grasp of the way into
    the Hierarchy grows steadily and your entire life will be taking on fuller and richer
    meaning. It is the world of meaning that we are trying to penetrate. You will then find
    that the succeeding degrees will open their doors to you, for you will be found to have
    covered the necessary preliminary work, to have assimilated a certain measure of technical
    and academic knowledge, to have certain spiritual contacts and arrived at certain great
    recognitions.
