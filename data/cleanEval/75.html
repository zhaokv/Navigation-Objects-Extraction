     1. An organisation or organisations planning to draw up a code of conduct may request the Data Protection Commssion to declare that, given the particular features of the sector or sectors of society in which these organisations are operating, the rules contained in the said code properly implement this Act or other legal provisions on the processing of personal data. Where a code of conduct provides for the arrangement of disputes about its observance, the Commission may only issue a declaration, if guarantees have been provided for its independent character.
     <br>
      2. The provisions of (1) are likewise applicable to amendments or extensions to existing codes of conduct.
      <br>
       3. The Commission shall only consider requests where, in its opinion, the requester or requesters are sufficiently representative and the sector or sectors concerned are sufficiently precisely defined in the code.

Where a declaration is requested for an amendment to a code of conduct for which a declaration has already been issued previously, the declaration shall apply for the duration of the declaration issued previously.

Within the time limit provided for an appeal based on the General Administrative Regulations Act or referred to in Article 46(2), the party concerned may apply to the Data Protection Commission with a request to mediate or give its opinion in the dispute with the responsible party, or make use of the provisions concerning the arrangement of disputes in a code of conduct which has been the subject of a declaration as referred to in Article 25(1). In that case, notwithstanding Article 6:7 of the General Administrative Regulations Act, the appeal may still be lodged or the court proceedings provided for in Article 46 still initiated after the party concerned has received notice from the Data Protection Commission, or further to the provisions concerning the arrangement of disputes in a code of conduct which has been the subject of a declaration as referred to in Article 25(1), that the case has been dealt with, but at the latest six weeks after that moment.
