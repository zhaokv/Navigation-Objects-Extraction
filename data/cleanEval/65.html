               Jon Lasser began the Bastille Linux Project in order to harden the
security of Red Hat Linux, the distribution he uses at work.  In the
process, he began looking at the other distributions to see how they
handle security updates, and he was not at all happy with what he
found.  In today's editorial, he shares his concerns and explains why
it matters to you even if you do all your security monitoring for
yourself.

                 As a professional Unix systems administrator, I'm concerned about
system security. Keeping unauthorized users off my systems is simply
part of my job; doing this requires vigilance in the form of
monitoring performance, reading logs, and keeping patches up-to-date.
For me, security is about security; it's about keeping my users'
projects safe and keeping them comfortable despite a full-time
connection to the Internet.

                 , a hardening script for Red Hat Linux, I
thought my job was to make Linux more secure so beginning users could
easily keep their boxes secure. Often, new Linux users have no
experience as system administrators or often even any experience with
Unix. I thought the best way to tackle the problem was to make it easy
to do the right thing.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Recently, I've been asked lots of questions about Linux system
security by reporters. Often, I'm put on the defensive right away: Does
Linux have a security problem? Why is Linux less secure than other
operating systems? Is open-source software inherently less secure than
commercial systems?
                </p>
                <p>
                 I usually begin by explaining that more holes are reported in
open-source software
                 <em>
                  before
                 </em>
                 they're exploited, and that the
number of actually-exploited holes is no greater -- perhaps even less --
than commercial software. I explain that one reason there are so many
break-ins into Linux systems is that there are so many Linux systems on
the Internet, and I explain that Linux can be as secure as any other
operating system.
                </p>
                <p>
                 But Linux does have a security problem. It's not a universal problem,
but look at the following list of security Web sites, mailing lists, and
update tools for some common Linux distributions:

                 These are all mainstream Linux distributions, tending towards a
general audience; at the least, they're not aiming at the router market
or the embedded devices market. These are all products intended to be
used by normal people and thrown up on a corporate network or even
the Internet. Some may be aimed at relatively expert users, but I'm
a fairly advanced user myself, and I still expect that my software
distributor is watching out for security at least minimally. That's
one of the reasons I don't roll my own distribution.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Of the eight common distributions I could think of, three have
nothing whatsoever to do with security, and at least one of the
others didn't seem to be doing anything useful. No wonder Linux has a
security problem: while those four distributions have probably less
than a quarter of the Linux market, they tend to be high-profile
distributions which garner more than their share of media coverage.
                </p>
                <p>
                 These distributions aren't just putting their users at risk; they're
damaging Linux's credibility and its image in the marketplace. Every
time I'm asked by a reporter why Linux is so insecure, I have to
consider Caldera, Corel, Turbo Linux, and Slackware before I can answer.
These distributions' total lack of concern with security is an
embarrassment to the entire Linux and Open-Source communities.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Because of these distributions, I'm forced to admit to reporters
that many Linux installations are insecure, and there's little the
average user can do about it without dedicating an inordinate amount of
time to security work. Most users aren't paid to worry about security,
as I am. For many, computing may be only a small part of their work.
These people can't rightly be asked to read Bugtraq; they've got work to
do.
                </p>
                <p>
                 If only systems were kept up to patch, huge numbers of systems
wouldn't be cracked. On the university campus where I work, systems have
been exploited using the automount daemon bug which is more than a year
old, and which has been patched nearly that long. Being a professional,
I know that they shouldn't even be running it, because I know that
they're not using it. But I can't expect them to know, and I can't even
fix it myself: I didn't know that some of these machines existed
until I found out that they'd been hacked. Asking these users to read a
single, low-volume, vendor-specific mailing list is a pretty good
solution -- when those lists exist.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Experienced users should abandon Linux distributions which don't
provide security fixes in a timely manner and post that information to a
Web site, a mailing list, or both. They should abandon these
distributions not because they necessarily need the security notices
for themselves, but because these distributions are ruining Linux's
image not only with novice users, but with the reporters and editors who
shape managers' opinions on whether Linux is a viable solution.
                </p>
                <p>
                 You may claim that you're a hobbyist, and you couldn't care less if
businesses use Linux; that's your right, certainly. However, you lose
nothing when businesses use Linux, you lose nothing when security
updates are made available and publicized, and you gain nothing when
businesses reject Linux because some vendor couldn't be bothered to
package up an already publicly-available solution to a security
hole.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The rest of us do lose.  It hurts our professional reputations when
we stand behind a piece of software with frequent and
highly-publicized security lapses.  It wastes our time, tracking down
hacked user machines for which we're not responsible and rebuilding
them from the ground up.  It wastes our money, when businesses and
government agencies buy more expensive hardware and software for the
illusion of security.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Solving this problem isn't difficult or time consuming; simply pick
distributions which express a basic level of concern for security

is that in

                    You turn on your machine, it boots Windows, you hit the Start button,
you chose a program, it runs.  If there's a problem, an "engine problem"
indicator lights up on the dashboard.
                   </li>
                   <li>
                    You get in your Geo, put the key in the ignition, turn it on, put the
gearshift in Drive, step on the gas, and go.  If there's a problem, a
"General Fault" message pops up on the screen.

                    You turn on your machine, it boots Linux/BSD/Solaris/FooNIX, you watch
the startup messages for any errors, you type in your login and password,
you get a shell prompt, maybe you type "startx" to get a nice GUI.  You
now have your choice of hudreds of commands, tools, utilities, compilers,
editors, and apps to bring to bear on the problem at hand.  If there's a
problem, a core file and a ton of log messages are spewed out to tell the
user exactly what part broke, and whether or not it's going to compromise
the stability of the rest of the system.
                   </li>
                   <li>
                    You step out on the flight line, do a thorough walkaround of your F-22
checking for any potential problems, hop in the cockpit, enter your
authentication code, crank up the turbines, taxi out to the end of the
runway, get clearance from the tower, and take off.  You now have your
choice of hundreds of possible maneuvers, and a wide array of avionics,
ECM, and weaponry to bring to bear on the problem at hand.  If there's a
problem, diagnostic information gets spewed out at the pilot to tell him
exactly what part broke, and whether or not it's going to compromise the
airworthiness of the aircraft.

                  <p>
                   The driver of the Geo doesn't need to know how the engine works, or how to
repair it, in order to get from point A to poing B.  That's what the
mechanic is for.  If there's a problem, an "engine problem" indicator
lights up on the dashboard.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Likewise, the driver of the F-22 doesn't need to know how the radar,
avionics, and engine work, or how to repair them, in order to shoot down
the other guy.  That's what the ground crew is for.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The persond driving F-22, however, must have a great deal more knowledge
of and competence in the physics involved in maneuvering the vehicle than
the driver of the Geo.

                   The "driver" of the Windows box doesn't need to know how files are stored
on disk, or how an interrupt vector tells the CPU that the sound card
wants some attention.  He does need to know enough to use the Start-&gt;Shut
Down menu item, instead of just turning off the power.  He
                   <b>
                    should

                   know enough not to run any .exe files or open any word files that haven't
been virus scanned.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The "driver" of the Linux box doesn't need to know what an inode is, or
how System V IPC works.  He does need to know how to log on and off
properly, and how to read basic error messages that show up on the
console, how to use the shutdown command. He
                   <b>
                    should
                   </b>
                   know the basics
of configuring and compiling a kernel, and locking down inetd.conf and the
rc.* files.

                   In a corporate environment, most of the more complicated stuff for either
system is handled by the IT staff.  They take care of things like
firewalls at the edge of the corporate network, and shutting off telnet,
ftp, rpc, and other such things on machines that don't need them up.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   At home, it's a different story.  Someone using a computer at home is most
likely either dialing a modem in to an ISP, or connecting full time with an
ISDN or DSL link. (Unless they're a total geek, and have set up their own
10.0.0.0 network behind a dedicated NAT-ing/Firewalling box ...)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Sadly, most people don't realize the risk they're putting themselves at by
doing this without installing and configuring security tools.  Even a
simple thing like NukeNabber for Windows can help avert a system
compromise, if the user is aware enough to yank the phone line out of the
wall when a port scan is detected by it.  I have little sympathy for
people who's machines get compromised due to their own ignorance and
incompetence.

                    Everyone who is interested should teach themselves about how computers and
networks work, how to configure them, etc. But the reality is that in the
long run, to use your car analogy, the people who configure computers are
more like car mechanics, not car drivers. CEOs will not ever learn much,
if anything, about how computers work. For them it's a tool, not a hobby.
It's much more cost effective to have an expert configure their computer
than it is for them to do it themselves.

wood in the general direction of the blades without wearing safety glasses
or knowing where the scram switch is, and assuming you won't get a splinter

that the scripts (the one's I've used, at least) only run at install time.
I think a better
   way to do it would be to have an install script that detected the
hardware, installed the kernel and other non-optional packages, then
rebooted into
   console mode. Then, use a general purpose tool (one that you could run
again later) to enable and disable services, and install/uninstall

installation, and adjust what daemons are available by default
accordingly.  Perhaps they are a bit permissive with things like telnet,
ftp, nfs, and other services, but that's only in accordance with the UNIX
tradition, where these services are expected to be available.  If you have
a problem with that, there's always OpenBSD, which shuts everything except
SSH off by default.

                      First, I'm glad the discussion has risen from the gutter. I think some of
these slackeware types need to starting dealing with their anger...
                      <br>
                       <br>
                        I have to disagree with RichD's premise that every UNIX user must be
responsible for understanding UNIX security. I'm a newer Linux user (less
than two years), so I don't have the same perspective as the old-timers. I
don't see Linux as a hobbyist's toy, I see it as a tool that I'd like to be
able to use at work (much as Mr. Lasser was talking about). In a LAN
setting, not everyone is a sysadmin, and in fact, that could never work.
People can be perfectly productive UNIX users without understanding
anything about inetd.conf. I know I was for years.
                        <br>
                         <br>
                          For Linux to make it in the corporate world, the boxes need to be easy
to set up as LAN workstations and easy to keep up to date with software
patches. One person must be able to maintain 10's or 100's of "secure
enough" Linux boxes. In my mind that should be the goal, and tools like
AutoRPM and Bastille Linux are the right approach.
                          <br>
                           <br>
                            Linux advocates talk about displacing Windows, but it will never
happen until secrataries and CEOs can be productive on Linux, too. And
believe me, they barely understand what their account name is.
                            <br>
                             <br>
                              With regards to distro install scripts, one thing I find annoying is
that the scripts (the one's I've used, at least) only run at install time.
I think a better way to do it would be to have an install script that
detected the hardware, installed the kernel and other non-optional
packages, then rebooted into console mode. Then, use a general purpose
tool (one that you could run again later) to enable and disable services,
and install/uninstall software. That way turning on and off services would
not be such a big deal, since they could easily tweeked later using the
same, easy to use, vendor specific tool. This might make it more practicle
to turn off more services by default.

                       I find fault not with Slackware, or Red Hat's policy on custom packages
being included. My issue only is with the install programs from the
distros. A linux install with all of the services turned off is fairly
secure. This is not entirely practical.
                       <br>
                        <br>
                         Anyone intending to use their computer as a server should make it their
responsibility to keep themselves informed and their server running only
new software. I find it a little humorous when someone sets up a web
server, and maybe an ftp server, and a portscan reveals 20 open ports.
Thats insecure. And that is about right for any default install of most
distributions. I have always used slackware and yes, I felt it was in a
beta-stage until v7.0.
                         <br>
                          <br>
                           My message is only that multiple inetd.conf files should be included with
every distribution, and the user should have the opportunity to choose
from several options:
                           <br>
                            <br>
                             Secure: for single users - no open ports
                             <br>
                              Medium: for remote-admin nodes - telnet, ssh, just the 'portant stuff
                              <br>
                               Insecure: for the hacker who will do it all themself anyways :)

                                 I find it discontenting that distributions include soooo many services on
by default...

                        OpenBSD.  By default, remote access services are disabled until the admin
explicitly goes into inetd.conf and enables them.

                       <p>
                        Slimy is correct in saying that I miss the point of the main article in my
previous post.  I wasn't aiming for it.  I intended the post in context
with the other replies talking about how there should be a distro that is
"secure" out of the box.  (I guess I missed that by a hair, too ;)
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        The simple truth remains that there just is no such thing.  The security
of any system, no matter what OS it is running, is a function of the
cluefulness of the admin.  A well run Linux box will be more secure than a
poorly run OpenBSD install.  A well run NT server will be more secure that
a shoddily maintained Solaris 7 box.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Of course, the only way to have a system that is completely secure from
being hacked on the 'net, is not to have it on the 'net at all.  Then all
you have to deal with is the security of physical access to the machine
itself ... we've all seen the draconian measures that Hollywood producers
can think of to try and do that, and Tom Cruise was still able to steal
data off of it in

                         While I agree with RickD's comment (especially the first paragraph), I
believe it misses the main point of the article.
                         <br>
                          Clearly, one must learn Unix if one expects to administer a Linux
machine.  And that includes home users.  But still, most Linux
Distributions that I have run across, Slackware and Debian included, make
assuptions about system installations that are not, from a security
standpoint, logical.   For example, installing a telnetd server by default
is probably not a good idea.  Having it installed and configured to accept
remote connections by default is horrific!  Yet this was the case when I
installed Debian 2.1.  Debian 2.2 (Potato) is a little smarter than this,
but thats not the official release (yet).
                          <br>
                           As anyone who has delt with security issues for some time will tell
you: the best security policy you can adopt is "that which is not
explicitly allowed is denied".  More distributions need to take this into
account.
                           <br>
                            If I want a telnet server, I will ask for it.  And when I install it,
I would expect that: at best, it would not aceept connections from
anywhere until I told it otherwise; at worst, it would accept local
connections only, until I told it otherwise.

                          Linux is a UNIX style operating system.  UNIX was not originally intended
for the "casual" or "home" user ... they just didn't exist in 1969.
                          <br>
                           <br>
                            Linux, the BSDs, and any UNIX flavor, for that matter, requires the
user to have a given level of cluefulness.  IMNERHO, this is a Good Thing.
 The plain, simple, ugly truth is that if you don't know what inetd.conf is
for, if you don't know where your startup scripts are and how to edit them,
if you don't know how to set up your anonymous FTP server correctly, etc.
etc. etc. ... then *you* *should* *NOT* *be* *using* *UNIX*!!!!!
                            <br>
                             <br>
                              The flip side of that is that anyone can easily obtain the
documentation and learn how to do all of these things, as well as all the
other tasks required to keep a UNIX system up and running properly.  This
has the effect (or at least the potential) of raising the computer
literacy level of the general public.
                              <br>
                               <br>
                                Sadly, most people think of their computer the same way they think
about their television set, their microwave, and their car.  The way I see
it, computers are actually more akin to power tools -- if you don't read
the instructions and/or get proper training in their use, you're gonna get
hurt.
                                <br>
                                 <br>
                                  There are a few simple truths about the Internet as it stands today
that many, if not most, people overlook:
                                  <br>
                                   <br>
                                    1- The Internet, like Downtown(tm), is *NOT* a safe place.  Anyone who
attatches a computer or a network to the Internet is placing themselves at
risk.  There are malicious people out there who want to steal your
information, just like there are malicious people out there who want to
steal your wallet.  There are Script Kiddies out there who want to deface
your website, just as there are Junior Gangbangers out there who want to
tag your house/car/fence/wall/place of business.
                                    <br>
                                     <br>
                                      2- You gotta cover your own ass.  Ultimately, your computer's safety
is your responsibility, just like your personal safety is your own
responsibility.  Companies have sysadmins who get paid to keep the network
secure.  They also have security guards and alarm systems and such to keep
the physical premeses physically secured.  At home, you have locks on your
doors, and perhaps an alarm system, to help keep intruders out of your
home.  I say "help" because the fact remains that if someone really wants
to break into your house, they will, alarm system notwithstanding.  The
same is true for computers on the 'net.  If someone *really* wants to get
in, they will.  There are, however measures that can be taken to make it
much more difficult.
                                      <br>
                                       <br>
                                        Yes, there are people out there who are trying to help look out for
everybody's safety, just like there are police patrolling the streets
looking out for everyones safety ... and they're about as effective.  The
fact remains that if you don't know how to spot a potential mugger, and if
you don't bother learning basic personal safety practices (like scanning
the area for potential baddies before unlocking your car door or
approaching your home, or being able to spot the scratches on the lock and
door frame that indicate forced entry), you're much more likely to get
mugged than the person who *has* bothered to learn these things.
                                        <br>
                                         <br>
                                          Similarly, if you don't bother learning basic computer safety
practices (like editing inetd.conf, and configuring firewalling), you're
much more likely to get cracked that the person who *has* learned these
things.
                                          <br>
                                           <br>
                                            It doesn't take much.  Anyone who has any semblance of intelligence
higher that that of an earthworm can figure out how to edit their
inetd.conf file to turn off unecessary daemons.  Configuring IPChains is a
piece of cake, if you bother to read the FAQ and HOWTO.
                                            <br>
                                             <br>
                                              I have no sympathy for anyone who whines about how hard it is to set
up a Linux/BSD/UNIX system.  "But Windows just works" is the party line
... primarily because most people never actually *do* a Windows install. 
They buy computers from the local consumer electronics store, which come
with Windows preinstalled (by someone who gets paid to install Windows on
dozens or hundreds of computers a day), and have no clue how insecure they
are when they hit that Dialup Networking button to go surfing the net.
                                              <br>
                                               <br>
                                                At least Linux and the other freeware Unices *have* easily accessible
mechanisms like inetd.conf, and firewalling tools like IPChains that allow
them to be made more secure.  At least the users of these systems know (or
should know) that there are security issues to be addressed.
                                                <br>
                                                 <br>
                                                  Most Windows users are blissfully unaware that they are wide open to
many attacks that can crash their machines, and many more attacks that
take advantage of their ignorance to use email attatchments, JavaScript,
ActiveX, and other such methods to install backdoors into their systems. 
Furthermore, most Windows users have no simple method to block such
attacks against their home box that they use to dial directly into the
'net.
                                                  <br>
                                                   <br>
                                                    When these users load Linux, without taking the time to learn about
the issues involved, they remain just as ignorant of their security
situation as they were when they were running Windows.
                                                    <br>
                                                     <br>
                                                      People take the time to attend self defense and "street smarts"
seminars, and martial arts classes to learn how to protect themselves in
the Real World(tm).  They watch the news to find out if there is a serial
rapist in town this week.  They lock their doors and windows at night, and
turn on the alarm system to keep the burglers out.
                                                      <br>
                                                       <br>
                                                        Is it really to much to expect people to take the time to learn the
relatively simple techniques (like editing out unneeded daemons from
inetd.conf and their startup scripts, and configuring firewalling like
IPChains) that will lock down their Linux box to keep the Script Kiddies
out?

                           Agreed, the paper did seem like an attack on Slackware do to the complete
misconception about Volkerding's view on security.  The sites and lists
have been pointed out enough in the comments.  The man has appologized so
lets move on.

                             This article was a good one.  Unfortunately most people missed the point. 
I don't think it was intended to tell us what distribution to use, or who
to boycott; rather, it was intended to tell us what we should do about
security, why we need it, etc.  The common quote from most web site
defacers is "Security is a Myth".  This is true for the most part, but if
we all look at security and pay attention to it rather than sloughing it
off, it doesn't have to be a myth.

                            Being the person at Caldera who's responsible for security issues, I felt
not just a little insulted by your claim that Caldera is one of the
distributions that doesn't to anything about security.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            You write, in trying to apologize for your unfair treatment of Slackware:
``In the old days [...] Slackware had huge numbers of security holes.''
This sentence enforces my suspicion that your article is based much more
on dated stereotypes than real understading of what goes on in the Linux
security area.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            If you go back to some time around 95, I grant you that Linux
distributions used to resemble leaky buckets more than a secure OS. This,
and the fact that Linux was ignored both by CERT and (to a large degree)
by bugtraq as well lead to the establishment of various Linux security
resources--such as a the linux-security list.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            Since then, most Linux distributors, including Caldera, have started to
put a lot more emphasis on security. There is even a certain
amount of information sharing and coordination concerning security issues
among Linux distributors.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            I have personally audited most if not all setuid applications and a
number of network servers shipped with OpenLinux. Linux as a
whole has profited from this. And we're not the only Linux vendor
trying to address security problems proactively.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            Working in the security area myself I can on the other hand understand
your apparent frustration. Making an operating system more secure is an
uphill battle you cannot win. Distributors make mistakes in integrating
software with their product (or they make choices you consider a mistake).
Programmers insist on putting the same bugs into their programs over and
over again (do a grep strcpy over the pine sources one day). Many users
expect things to "just work" and don't take security serious until they
get hacked.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            However don't blame distribution maintainers for a problem that has many
more facets--especially if your assignment of blame is based on sloppy
research.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            On the overall scale, Linux security has improved a lot over the past few
years--and while I agree that there's a long way to go, progress will
depend at least as much on creating more secure software in the first
place as on the vendors' timely delivery of patches.

                               <br>
                                I read this a few hours ago, but thought it best to hold any comments
for awhile -- A while has passed.
                                <br>
                                 <br>
                                  First, I do not blame Mr. Lasser for this article.  Having experience
as an editor of a small, international law enforcement journal... I know
that the old adage "Don't shoot me, I'm just the messenger" holds no water
in the journalism business.  Mr. Covey... shame now, did we not learn at
least one thing from the cinema classic "Real Genius"?  "Never forget to
check your references!"  (I think the kids still like it when I "get down"
verbally).
                                  <br>
                                   <br>
                                    Mr Lasser, I note that you have made an attempt, albeit feeble, but
what appears to be an attempt non the less at saying you are sorry?  If
this was an apology... then I, as a card carrying Slacker, accept -- Thank
you.
                                    <br>
                                     <br>
                                      Now if I may make a comment or two?  I do not claim to know even a
fraction of what you, MR. Lasser, know about computer security.  I only
started *tinkering* with computers in 1984 --  The majority of my security
experience is more with MP5s than MD5.  But, as anyone who knows me (or has
had the misfortune of finding my web site) knows, I have made a real
dedication towards network security.
                                      <br>
                                       <br>
                                        I seem to have taken a different, I like to think more practical,
approach to finding what flavor of Linux I would use for my firewall and
secure OS base.  Rather than which distro was the most popular and had the
most support, I chose the one that (IMO) needed the least work: Slackware! 
But that is not why I am writing, I hope to offer a simple explanation that
seems too often missed -- Or, misunderstood.  Anyway, this is what I have
picked up in the last couple of decades...
                                        <br>
                                         <br>
                                          The notion that anyone can completely protect something is silly...
noble, but silly.  There is no security panacea -- and look closely at
those who claim to have it, odds are there little wagons have the words
"snake oil" freshly painted over  on the sides.  It is this sort of
thinking that drives a company to spend $180,000.00 on a high-tech,
laminated steel door - mounted in hardened and reinforced concrete &amp; steel
frame and casement - featuring hinges and locksets made of solid
unobtanium!  Then put that door between two windows made of genuine
glass?
                                          <br>
                                           <br>
                                            This is the same rational that has System Administrators walking
around touting their new mega buck, AI powered, Super-Cyber-Crypt-Keeper
Software... while EVERY terminal (even the one that customers can use in
the lobby) has a functional floppy drive! (yes, I have seen this).
                                            <br>
                                             <br>
                                              Security (my definition) is a measure of time -- a double ended time
line, separated in the middle by an event... a breach or loss (X).  One
the left side of that event is the time leading up to it, the time before
it happens -- not if, rather when.  To the right of the event, is the time
it will take to recover from the event -- to fully negate the loss.

                                                  Security is any effort that moves the event (X) further to the right,
in fact all effort should be to move the event as far as possible to the
right -- in a perfect world, a security compromise is only a threat until
it is discovered, after action and contingency plans are already tested
and in place... negation is immediate.

                               Different distributions try to address different issues as seen by
different kinds of users, all with different experiences and different
goals.  The very fact we have so many distributions attest to the
diversity of the user base.  This is something that Linux distributions
(and their BSD cousins) have over that commercial OS we've heard about.
                               <br>
                                <br>
                                 One size does NOT fit all.  It never did, and it never will.  What a
hacker needs, or what a hobbyist needs, or what a web site needs, or what
a system administrator needs, or what an office manager needs, or what a
salesman needs ... all these things are different.
                                 <br>
                                  <br>
                                   I can certainly says from experience as a system administrator that
the most secure systems are the result of a skilled administrator taking
the time to get all the necessary information (and keep up to date so you
are a moving target) and apply all the necessary upgrades and
configurations.  However, a system administrator is not going to be
setting up most machines anymore as Linux begins to bump out that other OS
from the desktop.  Indeed, many server situations fall into that arena.  If
I were to set up and configure a Linux desktop for someone, there are a LOT
of things I'd be doing to the system AFTER installing the distribution,
with security changes being in the lead position, and other things like
manageability being next (for example, cleanup scripts that ensure logs
don't fill up /var).
                                   <br>
                                    <br>
                                     There are a lot of things a distribution could do to make life HELL
for a system administrator, but making EVERYTHING be defaulted to turned
OFF is not one of them.  I've used both Slackware and Redhat and I have to
do a lot to both (more to Redhat but still a significant amount to
Slackware) to make them secure.  I don't clean inetd.conf ... I shut off
inetd itself ... on many systems.  Every distribution should leave every
service that could listen on a port or pipe turned off, even lpd.  During
install, and at any time later, there can be the option to enable specific
services.  But unless those actions are taken, the services should be
installed in such a way they are not running until properly turned on.
                                     <br>
                                      <br>
                                       This would be to the best benefit of end users who have little or no
time to keep themselves security aware, and as a system administrator, I'd
much rather have to go turn things on than have to turn them off.  It would
not break any distribution to do it this way.

                                Jon Lasser brings up some very good points, and his editorial is
well-suited to the Linux community.  As one of several student Unix
sysadmins in the computer science department, I have to deal with the same
types of things he does.  One of the reasons we've opted not to go with
Linux 100% but instead concentrated on IRIX and Solaris is because (1) we
feel IRIX has a proven track record of being more stable and secure than
Linux; and (2) because Solaris provides a proven environment in which our
CS students can code.  This does not prevent many attempts to exploit our
machines, however.  On the average, I spend nearly twenty minutes *per
hour* scrounging through logs and checking stats to ensure that my fellow
students are safe at what they do best (coding).

This does not come at an easy price.  Since I'm only one of a few
security-minded student sysadmins, I have to make sure that my coworkers
are kept current on the latest exploits, security advisories and fixes,
etc.

[I mean this as no offense to anyone, but I've also noticed that the irc
network EFNet seems to split a lot more often now that Linux ircds have
popped up.  Things weren't this way when they stuck to *BSD daemons. 
*sigh*]

I simply wish we could all just listen to what Jon Lasser was trying to
point out instead of nitpicking over the details of whether or not a
particular distribution has security lists/pages/whatnot.

                                 I have to chime in on the 30 min/day / 5 min/month issue... If 1000
programmers that bill out at $100/hr spend 5 minutes every month checking
for updates, in a year that's a loss of $100k...

                                  Its a _natural_ human reaction to defend your favorite [friend|ice cream
flavor|car|religion|pet goldfish|child|pez dispenser|whatever], especially
against undue and misleading criticism. When you criticize someones
favorite thing youre criticizing them for choosing that thing as their
favorite... pretty elementary principle... why do people have such a hard
time understanding it?

security fixes in a timely manner and post that information to a Web site,
a mailing list, or both. They should abandon these distributions not
because they necessarily need the security notices for themselves, but
because these distributions are ruining Linux's image not only with novice
users, but with the reporters and editors who shape managers' opinions on
whether Linux is a viable solution."

                                                   Yes of course I am bias towards Slackware. It is in my opinion the best
distribution. I have used Debian, RedHat and Stampede along some of the
BSD flavors. I am not going to say Slackware is the most secure Linux, but
that is only because I agree with the comment about the administrators
being the security. As far as getting a distribution secure in a short
amound of time, Slackware is darn good.

                                                     Recently a RedHat loving (Once Slackware despising) friend of my'n was
amazed at how easy slackware is to configure ( without all the junk in the
way ) and has since changed distributions. Slackware is quite offten
smashed and bashed. It seems mostly by people who either haven't used it,
or NEED a GUI with pretty pictures to run a computer.

                                    Unfortunately most people who've responded have missed the whole point. 
All major distributions which I'm aware of come out of the box with too
many services enabled, and too many potential holes for new users to cope
with. They could all use a front-end script or dialogue which would ask
new users what actually needs to be enabled, and then disable everything
else by default.  I would rather assume that users who need the services
will need to learn enough about the process to be able to enable them
themselves anyway.
                                    <br>
                                     <br>
                                      The author makes a good point that if newbie users start having
security problems all over the place because services they know nothing
about and could care less about are enabled by default, this could have a
detrimental impact on the Linux community in general with bad press if,
for example, many thousands of these unsuspecting users become mail relays
and stop-over points.
                                      <br>
                                       <br>
                                        I've used a number of the major distributions, and to my knowledge
they are all guilty of this. They should come out of the box with all
services disabled by default.
                                        <br>
                                         <br>
                                          The users who need these services will do the necessary research (it
is hoped) to be able to use them in the most secure way possible, and to
keep on top of security advisories etc.  But you can't expect everyone who
just wants to use Linux for themselves to be on top of it all.

                                     The feedback gained from this editorial demonstrates one facet of the linux
community that I find tremendously  childish and immature - religious
dedication to individual distributions.  As much as I am a linux advocate;
linux is an operating system, to be used.  Some people appear to shift the
focus from the operating system to a particular vendor's own cobbling
together of software and scream loudly when there's even a
                                     <i>

                                      Jon stats that when he used slackware it was way back when the security
wasnt considerd. And that his article was written not in attempt to attack
slackware and other distro's but to show the need for security in linux. He
might not of ment for the attack on slackware but when a nobody, nerver
used linux user read's your article and decides to go with linux from the
facts that u offer he will determain to follow redhat when your facts arnt
uptodate or even fully looked into. Thats why it attacks slackware  because
the pertential users belive what they read. And this lowers the possable
users for  slackware to increase. Also i couldnt write a arctile on
Windows systems  if i had only run win 3.1 and win 98/2000 was latest
venture. I would only be showing my lack of facts on that subject.

                                       I think people are getting a little bit too inflamed over the mistakes
concerning slackware.

                                        <br>
                                         The point being made was, a lot of people use linux that do NOT have
time to, or even understand how to, secure their systems. Its exactly the
same with other more mainstream OSs - I know of several ppl who claim to
be NT admins, and yet dont even know where the MS security websites are.
                                         <br>
                                          <br>
                                           Sure, when I install a linux system I go through and clean out inetd,
add a decent ipchains firewall if appicable, and upgrade all the packages
that I know have security flaws.

                                             Does Jane Bloggs who just installed a redhat 6.0 (or *any* system) to
act as their companies dialup networking server and webserver know how to
do this?
                                             <br>
                                              <br>
                                               Would she know what cron *was*, much less that the redhat 6.0 rpm
happened to have a buffer overflow in it? (I think it was rh6.0 anyway)
                                               <br>
                                                <br>
                                                 Would she know what the significance of inetd.conf is, much less how
to secure it?
                                                 <br>
                                                  <br>
                                                   My take on the original article was not a dig at any particular linux
distribution - but a point about the level of education out there. And,
hand in hand with education, we have ease of accessability.
                                                   <br>
                                                    <br>
                                                     Half an hour a day, or even 5 minutes a day, might be enough to cover
the headlines of bugtraq and a vendor-specific security mailing list, but
someone telling Jane that she needed to upgrade her cron package because
of a nasty buffer overflow which could give root access wont mean a thing
unless
                                                     <br>
                                                      1) Jane knows if she uses the package
                                                      <br>
                                                       2) Jane knows if its relevant
                                                       <br>
                                                        3) Jane knows *how* to upgrade - be it installing a new rpm / deb, or
grabbing a source tarball, applying the relative patches, and compiling
it
                                                        <br>
                                                         <br>
                                                          I think there are a lot of people who use linux, because of the hype
surrouding it, who dont know what they are doing.
                                                          <br>
                                                           <br>
                                                            In my opinion, workstation distributions *should* be more or less
secure by default - with the exception of unforseen things like buffer
overruns in packages etc.  Why do you need to telnet into a workstation?
disable it by default. Why do you need ftp? pop3/imap? www? disable it. If
the user needs it, they can set it up themselves. They need to learn.
                                                            <br>
                                                             <br>
                                                              Similar sort of tactics should be taken on a server distribution.
                                                              <br>
                                                               <br>
                                                                Oh no, people will cry, that will make it too hard! No one will use
linux if its too hard!
                                                                <br>
                                                                 <br>
                                                                  Education....
                                                                  <br>
                                                                   <br>
                                                                    We dont need distributions that do everything for us - unless we
rolled it ourselves, and know what it does. What we do need is information
on *how* to secure it.
                                                                    <br>
                                                                     I thought the Bastille project was a good idea (although i never
actually used it). Things like this need to be fostered and encouraged.
                                                                     <br>
                                                                      <br>
                                                                       We currently have screeds of disjoint man pages, HOWTOs which dont
agree with your distribution (most of the ones i've read appear to work
with slackware, and bear no relevance to redhat), and package-supplied
readmes that can also bear no resemblance to your distribution-patched
binaries.
                                                                       <br>
                                                                        <br>
                                                                         I make a generalisation above, I know. But we need more distribution
specific information on how to do these things.
                                                                         <br>
                                                                          And it needs to be centralised, and put in a 'to-do' list so that new
users can *find* it easily enough.
                                                                          <br>
                                                                           <br>
                                                                            Hmm. I could have spent the time it took writing this, to instead
write a redhat-specific HOWTO's on securing your workstation by locking
down inetd, and checking for recent rpm updates.

Shell providing business, as you know are normaly the first targets of any
hack, exploit, etc.   Personaly I have tried many versions of Linux and
*nix systems to find that I personaly prefer Slackware Linux.  Not only
have I found Slackware to be more secure, with less exploits, I have found
it even easier to get the updates and install them with-in little time.  I
do have to state that Jon did make a large accident by stating that
Slackware did not have any mailing lists etc, especially since he is 
doing so without even using Slackware him self, which at least he was
honest about.

                                          The Slackware Linux developement team puts a lot of time into making
sure the distribution is as secure as posible before releasing it, and
personaly I think if Redhat put a little more time into do the same before
releasing each dist. it might be a bit more secure it's self.  Maybe I am
bias to Red Hat because I have seen it hacked so many times and at the
same time not very many people can hack Slackware, or maybe it's just my
experiance with Slackware that has drawn me to it, I am not sure. One
things for certain though, Slackware does have less exploits released for
each of there distributions.

much flaming on his editorial is because he didn't take the time to think
that before you judge something you should use it your self.  Many people
are opinionated on which Linux system people should use, as hard as that
is to believe, and tend to take things to the extreme when someone makes

as I have used Red Hat, Debian, OpenBSD, SCO, Solaris, and many other *nix

                                            1a) Can you _really_ make a system secure?
                                            <br>
                                             1b) Can you _really_ build a foolproof out-of-the-box linux
distribution that is secure without the user knowing what (s)he is doing
("linux for dummies")?

                                              <br>
                                               2a) OpenBSD is AFAIK considered one of the most secure OSs available.
How much time do you expect a sys admin to invest in system security to
keep it that way?
                                               <br>
                                                2b) Why do you expect  average linux users to act more efficiently
than experienced unix system admins concerning security?

                                           I think that there has been an adequate listing of the incorrect facts in
this article.  The author should probably go back, re-think the premise,
get his facts straight, and re-write and re-submit this editorial.  I
don't think that something so obviously full of omissions and (yes, even
we Linux people do it) FUD should be left posted in such a high-profile
location.  And Mr. Covey, (or someone from the FM staff) please do a
little fact-checking of your own on these?  Thank you.

                                            5 minutes a month is bullshit, if users dont want to spend any brain power
perhaps they shouldn't be using computers at all?
And as far as bettering the security on the net, im sure most distribs are
secure when they're released, it's just after time that people go looking
for problems, which is a good thing, but that is also why you should be
looking at least once a day, if you want to keep your box secure.
And my final comment for the day, when something has a mailing list, such
as slackware, it shows the maintainers are looking out for the problems
and putting them at one central location for the users to look at, see a
problem, then go and get the patch or do whatever needs to be done.

                                                 I am a linux advocate. not a Slackware or Debian or Redhat or *linux
advocate. Your blatent disregard for the facts is  normal .  No one seems
to care to research a liltle before going off on some rant about some
information they know very little about. You aparently didn't even bother
to email the heads of the distros to get a little info. You just went off
saying how your selected distro's security was the best... here are a few
examples.

                                                   1.   You mention "no official tool for automatic update."
                                                   <br>
                                                    By automatic do you mean... gets the patches and installs for you, you
get the patches (some format. rpm, deb,slack tgz, whatever) and it auto
installs? what? If you want a deamon to install patches for you over the
internet, you dont know the first thing about security.

you say... screw everything else... Get Redhat (top of the list), Debian,
SuSe or Mandrake.

linux's credability. You make blatently wrong statments out of lack of
knowledge and lack of desire to research an article before making a fool
out of yourself.

wronged... someone else defend them. I only use slackware, and dont know
much about other distros other than redhat, caldera, and mandrake.

10minutes would work just as

Really, non-hackers just can't be bothered with this kind of stuff. 
That's why, if you want to improve the overall security of the net and the
reputation of Linux as a whole, you need to secure it at the source: the
distributions need to be more secure by default, and it needs to be
possible for installations to remain secure without the end users having

                                                You have misinformed people. There is a Slackware security
mailing list. Slackware is secure and so is Debian. We're not
talking about 'the old days' here; we're talking `today`.
I hope you get a lot of flames on the subject, as you flamed
a lot of good distributions out there. Even in your sorry
message you don't stop flaming and make wrong assumptions
about certain distributions, since these cannot be called
facts. I don't know/care if you're getting paid to do this
but it certainly looks that way. Well, you obviously got a
name now, Jon Lasser.

                                                 Perhaps half an hour a day was a bit too much for the average person.
10minutes would work just as well, quick skim of the headlines on your
linux site or
reading the security mailing list. These are not hard nor time consuming
things to do. And as far as picking out one trivial thing, if he got this
wrong when it's blatently obvious and easy to find on the site (the
security list), i was wondering what
else he had missed or not cared to inform anyone of, in his pursuit of
this editorial.

                                                  I noticed about 3 people claiming that Slackware is quote "the most secure
distrobution" around.  This is in fact not true, and neather is saying
"Redhat is the most secure" or Debian or Caldera, or any distrobution or
Operating system.  Even your linux box in the corner of your office with a
static ip, with just telnet and ftp services running, and all the latest
patches you can think of put on it; is ALOT less secure then if you pull
out the ethernet wire.  In this day and age there is no "most secured"
linux distrobution. There is always something else you can do to make it
just a little more secure.
                                                  <br>
                                                   <br>
                                                    All the linux distrobutions include programs written by not the people
who released the distrobution.  Which means in fact, that hundreds of
different programs, written by hundreds of different people are on the
same computer.  Thos will also mean that there is a very likely chance
that one or more of those programs will have security problems.  And I am
not just talking about Linux, or just Unix in general.  Look at Windows 95
98 and certan versions of NT: Hundreds of programmers work on them, from
one major company, and there was a mistake in codeing that caused remote
users to be able to disconnect them from the internet.  Something like
that could happen in the linux world also, a popularly used program that
has a tragic flaw.
                                                    <br>
                                                     <br>
                                                      Personally though, as many other people have said, when first
installing any distrobution they have to spend time fixing up inetd.conf
disableing services that arent needed. Slackware is the same way, along
with other problems. So you can't say that out of the box Slackware is the
most secure, because it just plain isn't. Neather is anything.

                                                     Ok... maybe you can, but you should at least install and test the
latest version (especially with slack 7.0, since its changed quite a bit
since even 4.0, not to mention slack95) of the OS before stating "I have
to consider Caldera, Corel, Turbo Linux, and Slackware before I can
answer. These distributions' total lack of concern with security is an
embarrassment to the entire Linux and Open-Source communities."

lot recently :)

                                                    Exploits come out for Red Hat first because there are more targets on
the net. Exploits used to come out for SunOS 4.x for precisely the same
reason, but that didn't mean that Ultrix was more secure. (Point of fact,
it probably wasn't, it was just less tested.) And the fact that Red Hat
releases security fixes fairly promptly means that it's possible to secure
the system in a pretty much up-to-date fashion.
                                                   </p>
                                                   <p>
                                                    But that only answers half the question: so now I know why people take
Slackware to be the target (because I made a mistake which gave them a
foothold from which to attack me), but why do they think it's all about
Red Hat?  On the basis of the article, it seems clear that  SuSE, Debian,
and Mandrake are all probably more secure than Red Hat. The fact that I've
got a whole project just to secure Red Hat seems as much proof as any that
it's not especially secure -- but the fact that they've got some security
resources certainly means they're trying.

                                                    (And I started Bastille not to secure RH for myself, but because there
are dozens or hundreds of user-administered Red Hat boxes on the campus of
the university where I work. I need a way to secure those machines when I
have no direct control over them -- which means I need to secure the OS
they're already running.)

don't even mention Red Hat in the article except in the list of Linux
distributions and their security resources. I listed it up top because it
seems to have the largest number of users, not because it was the
best.

                                                     While Mr. Lasser makes some important points, the blantant misinformation
in his article certainly detracts from its overall impact. He has clearly
never used most of the distributions he disparages.

                                                      I think people took it as an attack on slack because what was said is
wildly untrue, slack may have been a pile of security holes in the past, i
dont know, as i said ive only been using it since 3.2, but i dont think you
should hold patrick to past mistakes, as slackware now is (IMHO) very
stable and secure.  Check out any exploit site and see how many exploits
there are against slackware vs. redhat or any other dists, people may
argue that this doesnt prove much, but it puts me at ease.

                                                       What I can't understand is how so many people who have been
involved with Unix and Linux for so long still use the term
hack to refer to a computer break in.  Machine's can get
hacked, but that's usually a good thing.  People getting
hacked?  Not too sure about it, but whoever it is might not
like it.  Hacking software, now that's something that's a
real good thing. There are many other kinds of hacks, some
of the more famous ones are listed at http://fishwrap.mit.edu/
none of these have to do with computer break in.
I agree though, that several distros are not secure to start with, and it
takes a lot of reading to secure a new system.

                                                        I went to the site and looked around before claiming not to
find anything, but somehow I still made a mistake.

                                                        I can't speak to the security or insecurity per se of Slackware 7, as
I've not used it, but I'll note that most of the recent security holes in
Red Hat and Debian (with the very notable exception of problems with Red
Hat's usermode tool -- a very, very serious problem) have been bugs in the
underlying code, not particularly related to either of those distributions.
If those bugs aren't present in Slackware, that's either because those
packages weren't included in Slackware (not a bad thing, just a point of
fact) or because Slackware fixed those bugs before anyone else knew about
them and failed to backpropogate the fixes. I don't think it's the
latter.
                                                       </p>
                                                       <p>
                                                        In the old days (pre 7.0, maybe another level back beyond that or so, I
can't remember the last version I used), Slackware had
                                                        <em>
                                                         huge
                                                        </em>
                                                        numbers of security holes. They just ignored them. And the sources never
seemed to be able to produce the binaries which were included -- sometimes
it was obvious that the included sources were pre-slackware-patches, as the
compiler would spew errors. I certainly hope (and to some degree expect)
that this situation's been cleaned up by now, but this made it impossible
to audit slackware's security if you wanted to.

                                                        But I'm really curious as to why everyone took this as an attack on
Slackware, specifically. It certainly wasn't intended to be that. I
certainly think that Slackware's record on security could stand
improvement -- I'm more impressed with a large number of found and fixed
bugs than an apparent lack of them in a full-featured Linux distribution
-- but as far as I'm concerned in the article, this isn't about any
particular distribution.

                                                        important, even if you
personally can handle yourself. Claiming otherwise is kind of like
claiming that ISO9660 filesystem support in Linux isn't worth keeping in
the kernel simply because you personally don't use it: it's a fundamental,
enabling feature of the environment for any number of users.

                                                        It's also about the importance of Linux's image in the media, and
simple things we can do to improve that image. If you personally don't
care who besides yourself uses Linux, that's fine. But I need Linux to
look good in the media, so that I can push for it in appropriate projects
at work and elsewhere. Also, a good image for Linux in the media makes it
more attractive for companies (ie Creative Labs) to write open-source
drivers for hardware which is nice to play with. :-)

Ive been using linux since slack 3.2 and ive found that slack is the most
secure distro, with debian coming in second and redhat coming in somewhere
near dead last, being the hackers paradise of buffer overflows and 'enabled
by default' services that it is.  As far as the security/patches/support
go, check out slackware.com and see whats at the very top of the page,
also slackware.com/lists.  While jeff did make some good points and touch
on some issues that need to be addressed, he should really take a closer
look at the actual OS next time.

that we have to build a religion around what distro we use and why the
others are evil? Its like watching a Baptist convention talking about the
evils of Catholics/Lutherans (and as about as worthwhile).

                                                          Slackware 7.0 is a very big improvement over earlier versions out there.
Patrick seems to be much more in tune with putting out things with the
4.0/5.0/6.0 Betas than I have seen him do in years (since the 2.x days). I
dont know the reasoning behind it, but once slackware.com came into
existance... the quality of the Slackware machines I dealt with seemed to
increase also. I dealt with too many people with hacked Slack95 boxes with
exploits that had been around way too long. Going to the cdrom.com site
usually had out of date info. Now I see a central site and people find
things rapidly and cleanly.
                                                         </p>
                                                         <p>
                                                          I used to use slackware up until 1996 when I switched to Red Hat because I
was tired of finding exploits and the Slackware response was "Well patch it
and compile it for yourself. We will put out a fix next release"... which
never came. When I found them in Red Hat, I saw an RPM at a central spot.
                                                         </p>

                                                          Now is Red Hat perfect?

always tighten things up here or there. However I know every time a change
is made to tighten security up... there are howls of "Why did you change
this/that." The same is true for SuSE, Caldera, etc. You get slammed no
matter what you do because a) people hate change, and b) people like to
whine versus deal.

is that Linux is not for System Administrators anymore

                                                          . Sorry most of the people who are using Linux
probably know only enough system administration to start a modem and stop
a modem... and that may be a stretch.  And that is what you get for having
an open community and saying things like "Stop using Microsoft... use
something better... also we are a community versus an elitist club like
XYZbsd, etc." (Not saying BSD is elitist, just a very common argument I
hear about why Linux is better).

                                                          Most people use computers as an ends to a means as JWZ said. They use them
to browse web sites, answer email, write documents and letters, scan
pictures in for a family album. The computer to them is nothing more than
a tool.. as much as the car gets them to and from work.
                                                         </p>

                                                          With this being the case, and being that we are supposed to be a better OS
and a better community... we need to make sure that we have a better
attitude towards security. I dont feel boycotts are needed. Tools that
help home users (not hobbyists) get working with Linux

                                                           Defining security without using the word "secure" is a task into itself. 
We've all installed a linux distribution, and we've all gone and cleaned
out inetd.conf.  All of us.  Everyone one of us.  Think about it.   How
much time and energy is wasted to clean out inetd.conf?  To turn off
portmapper?  To do all the rest?

                                                             This article doesn't compare Linux security t o Microsoft security, it
compares it to being absolutely secured.  I'd love to have a pre-secured
Linux box, and the way this new market works, if there are other people
like me out there, we'll find a distribution that does it, and switch to
it.  Others will see our choice and begin to follow suit.  Being "secured"
and remaining useful at the same time is a thin line to balance on.

                                                            I think one of the main concepts that is missed here is that the average,
non-expert, trying Linux because they're tired of Microsoft user doesn't
want a system that they have to do any real configuration on.  They want
everything to work, even if they have no need at all for the service
they're running.  You'll get users demanding that the ftp daemon work,
only for you to find out that they're logging in to the machine from the
same machine, and have no real need for it to be running at all.  Tell
them that it's a good idea to disable it, and they'll say that they
'might' need it, and want it there.  Current distros do seem to have
server written all over them, but that doesn't really seem to be the
market they're trying to hit lately.  Some companies don't have the
resources to re-release their software every week.  There are deadlins for
pressing the CDs, writing the manuals, testing the software, etc.., etc. 
It's not always very practical to try to include the latest fix every
other day in the released distro.  As for security advisories, for Caldera
go to http://www.calderasystems.com/support/security/  I love it when
people say things don't exist...

                                                             I have to agree with jwz on monitoring for security patches. That should be
the job of the system administrator(s). End users have more important
things to do (as far as the company is concerned) than monitoring patches
for their OS. If the system administrator doesn't know where to look for
security advisories and patches, then maybe it's time to find a new system
administrator. I am not a system administrator. I'm one of those geeks at
the company that brings in money on contracts. I have enough things to do
at work that I don't need the added burden of duplicating the work of my
company's system administrators (no matter how bad they may be).

                                                              <br>
                                                               That being said, I also have to agree with Nicko Acks in that Linux
distrobutions turn too many services on by default. Heaven forbid someone
should take the better route and leave everything off to begin with (like
OpenBSD) and then let the system admininstrator turn on only the services
he needs.
                                                               <br>

                                                                 Having many distros may be a plus, in some ways, but it's also a
definite minus too, considering that the (potential) user needs to
consider the pros and cons of each (or just run out and buy the newest
version of Red Hat like most people these days :p). And significant energy
is wasted duplicating efforts to keep patches up to date.

                                                              Okey, First,its not the flavor of Linux that you are ruinning, its the
person behind the computer. Computers don't get hacked, people do. If
Admins are stupid and don't know how to secure an OS, then certain people
will take advantage of them and their computers. Second, Redhat is bad.
Everytime a new version of Redhat comes out is because there are two
remote exploits for the previous version. Well, it just depends on the
admin, not the flavor of Linux system.

                                                               I can not believe someone that has been in the job area for anytime would
make those assumptions about Slackware.  It is by far the most secure
flavor out there.  And there are lists and sites for Slackware
www.slackware.com and www.linuxmafia.org just to name two.  When I do a
comparison of changelogs I see RH has about 10+ security fixes and growing
fast Slackware only has 2. In the 5.2 vs 4.0 we saw about 30vs3 . Redhat is
good mind you but should be saved for the workstation or webserver with no
users type install.  As long as they try and change programs from the
original authors intent they will have this problem they taint about 40%
of the apps included if you look at the odd ball versions they give them. 
Slackware on the other hand uses programs as is and does virtually no
modifications which always seems to get RH in trouble.  They have this
mindset that once they "brand" a program the user thinks its going to be
better I this is almost never the case and alot of this is done by what I
call "KTWFF" Kids That Work For Free.   As for the others Mandrake is
nothing more than a modified RH and falls into the same catagory Debian is
pretty good about security but also gets prone to the above but is still
much better.  Sorry to flame on so much but the public is so miss-informed
that it just scares me sometimes and the RH jaugernaut scares me also.  I
have been in this biz for some years now and when I get hired for consult
and I find they are running RH that is the first thing to go I dont knot
have the time to try and keep up with it.  Flame off

                                                                I am a bit suprised that such a "serious" guy can wrote this on slackware.
By experience, it's the most secured linux I know. People before me add
comment on the mailing list, and the repository of patch. You can notice
there are few patches, it's because Patrick Volkerding has always take
care of security in his distribution of linux before releasing it. there
are also less packages than other ones but I sleep better.
                                                                <br>
                                                                 <br>
                                                                  Your article is interesting, but I have the impression you only tell
obviousness : Yes, of course, users concern by security have to look for
tools (mailing list web page, etc ...) that give distributions before
making a choice. It's obvious !
                                                                  <br>

everybody, even if I think it's a bit dangerous. You simply want to be
dictator, choosing for everybody the good way...
                                                                   <br>
                                                                    An another point to answer to jwz, if you can't spend half an a hour
per day for security issues, security is definitely not a concern for you,
sorry. I'm a bit curious, what is your model of security OS ? Windows ? So
you never had a look on securityfocus (and others).
                                                                    <br>
                                                                     I can't see how we can have security actually without spend time for
it.
                                                                     <br>
                                                                      The power of linux is in distributions, everyone can find his "good"
distribution, so let the people of distributions works, help them, ask
them for new features, but don't ban them. You are missing the real enemy
and misunderstanding the open software.

used most of the major distributions and am forced
to use a few at work. As far as Slackware goes, it does have a security
mailing list which i am subscribed to, it can easily be found at
www.slackware.com
which also tells you that all of the current and future versions dir trees
will have a patch dir, with patches for that particular version.
I also sit on a 24/7 internet connection, with a static ip, i get at least
1 hack attempt a day. And strangely enough none of them seem to have
worked. Why? Because i spend half an hour a day checking new email for
problems,
and checking websites for problems with anything i'm running. So if this
professional sys admin has misinformed you of the slackware side of
linux,
what else could he be wrong about? I could be interpreting him wrong, or i
might just not be thinking clearly tonight, but i dont and never have had
problems
with the slackware distributions.
