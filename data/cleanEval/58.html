              To go on the academic job market requires that by late November you have one
pretty good paper, and two paper ideas. When first sending your packet to
departments, ask for a faculty list with research interests, so you will know
with whom you are dealing.

              2. When do you think you will finish your dissertation?
             </p>
             <p>
              Your odds of landing a job are higher if you can convincingly argue you will
be done by June (best) or at least by September. Employers do not like new
assistant professors to arrive with unfinished dissertations (although many
such assistant professors exist).
             </p>
             <p>
              3. What are you thinking about working on next?
             </p>
             <p>
              Describe one or two research projects that you would like to work on next.
You don't need to carry out these exact projects. You can include extensions of
your thesis: ideas it has spawned, or tests of it you will someday do. At least
one idea should be distinct from your thesis. On the other hand, don't be
scattered. Most of your ideas should hang together, as if you were writing a
book or two.
             </p>
             <p>
              4. What courses would you like to teach?
             </p>
             <p>
              Be sure to know the needs of the department before answering this one.
Mention undergrad and grad courses, and perhaps an advanced grad course. The
advanced courses are sought after; don't sound as if you demand to teach one.
Mention a service course (intro, micro, or macro) that you are willing to
teach.
             </p>
             <p>
              Know the text you might use in the course, particularly for undergraduates.
(You can ask around for plausible texts, and perhaps reading lists.) Think
about an outline of topics for one or two courses.
             </p>
             <h3>
              Questions to ask
             </h3>
             <p>
              The interviews are also for you to find out things. Also, asking questions
shows you are interested, and fills gaps in the conversation that the
incompetent interviewers leave when they run out of things to say. Do not
discuss money. There is lots of time for that.

             <p>
              The key to the interview is to be enthusiastic. Interviewers are looking for
(1) people who would accept an offer, and (2) nice colleagues. The first
consideration implies that you should have a reason why the interviewer's
school is really your first choice ("Oh, I just love -40 in winter and
searing heat in summer," she explained to the Minnesotans). The second
point implies that you must be friendly, witty, and easygoing (during the
high-pressure meetings!).

               Nothing
              </u>
              is more important than being friendly
and collegial. They are looking for someone they would like to have lunch with
every day-this dominates most other criteria.

              Writing a Dissertation
             </h1>
             <p>
              I was trained as a graduate student to read other people's research. Then I
finished my special field exams and was told to go write some research. I
compare my experience to learning how to read literature, then being asked to do
creative writing. Not unrelated, but hardly the same set of skills. Here is
some advice I found helpful when I was searching for a topic.
             </p>
             <p>
              <u>
               Hints for finding paper topics
              </u>
              : Choosing a paper topic requires
balancing the importance and feasibility of the topic. Feasibility involves
tractability for theoretical research, and data availability for empirical
research. I recommend creating a number of one-page paper proposals, each with
a topic sentence and data source.
             </p>
             <p>
              There are several heuristics for finding researchable paper topics. One way
is to list three of four papers you like. This list may hint at the style,
political point of view, level of abstraction, and methods that are appropriate
for you.
             </p>
             <p>
              Other paper ideas are motivated by bad research, not good: find statements
by policy-makers, analysts and journalists that make you angry, and find data
sets to address the issue. When studying for exams, keep a list of stupid
things you read to return to during the dissertation stage.
             </p>
             <p>
              Don't be afraid of normal science: repeating in a longitudinal data set what
others have done only in the cross section. Some paper ideas are data-driven:
read codebooks from a variety of data sets and see if certain questions spark
ideas or tests of theories you find interesting. For every paper you read,
think what else you would have done with that dataset or methodology.
             </p>
             <p>
              <u>
               Write a paper
              </u>
              , not a dissertation. A dissertation can be a daunting
prospect. If possible, focus on a 25-page paper with a clear one-sentence
topic. If you like this paper, then it can become the basis of a dissertation.
I promise you that just about any topic can grow to 150 pages; nearly all
topics students first choose are WAY too broad.
             </p>
             <p>
              <u>
               A dissertation is any stack of papers with three signatures on the top sheet
              </u>
              .
Paul Samuelson's dissertation was modestly entitled
              <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">
               Foundations of Economics
              </i>
              . It lived up to that title, and remains a
classic to this day. I initially felt that my dissertation should be, if not
that good, at least vaguely comparable in the sense of answering one of the Big
Questions.
             </p>
             <p>
              Do not fall prey, as I did, to the "magnum opus fallacy". A
dissertation should be normal science that certifies your competency. Save the
big thoughts in a file, and get finished! Write an opus when you are a professor,
and are being paid for it. Meanwhile, negotiate the smallest useful chunk of
the Big Project with your dissertation advisers, and do that single piece of
research.
             </p>
             <p>
              <u>
               A dissertation group is essential
              </u>
              . Having folks to bounce your ideas
off of at an early stage is irreplaceable. The members of your dissertation
group do not need to have similar fields; any smart person will be useful at
each stage of a project, from vague ideas through research design, and write
up. All you need are people who are willing to listen to raw ideas, and willing
to read first "pre-drafts" of chapters.

             <p>
              When people evaluate you for tenure, they need to know (1) who you are, and
(2) what (one or two sentences) results you are associated with. Thus, my basic
advice is focus your research, get it read, and get seen. Sadly, the visibility
of yourself is as important as the quality of your work in professional
success.
             </p>
             <p>
              <u>
               Have a theme
              </u>
              : You should think of your research as writing a book,
not articles. The idea is that your first five years' research should involve
one or two unifying themes.
             </p>
             <p>
              The reason for sticking to a theme is that people evaluating you need to be
able to say "This young scholar is one of the world's experts at
_______." You get to fill the blank. However, your work must hold together
so that there is
              <u>
               some
              </u>
              word or phrase they can stick in the blank.
             </p>
             <p>
              In an ideal world, academics would be able to study any important topic they
were competent to shed light on. In the real world, assistant professors are
being evaluated; you don't need to play the game I describe, but now you know
the rules.
             </p>
             <p>
              <u>
               Get read
              </u>
              : List people who should read your papers. The list should
include at least three groups: a dozen or so senior people in your field who
are likely to write letters evaluating you when you go up for tenure;
classmates and other buddies who are likely to actually read the stuff; and
people who work on related topics and you would like to cite your stuff. Make
up a master list that receives most papers, and modify it for each paper. Look
at each paper's bibliography for ideas on who might want to see it. (Everyone
wants to see papers that cite them -- that's why so many professors read papers
from the back.)
             </p>
             <p>
              Typically you should mail out papers in their working paper stage, one draft
before submission.
             </p>
             <p>
              Feedback is crucial. All research has flaws, and all drafts have
easy-to-correct flaws. Make sure your research and writing has lots of feedback
to fix both types. Especially for the clarity issues, be open minded. If your
parents, friends, colleagues in unrelated disciplines, will read the sucker,
send it to them!
             </p>
             <p>
              <u>
               Get seen
              </u>
              : Travel every year to give seminars. If you are going to be
near a university, call up six months early and tell them you are available and
would like to give a seminar.
             </p>
             <p>
              Don't be shy: figure out how to give a talk at your field's annual
convention, and do it! Invite a mix of friends and more well-known people.
             </p>
             <p>
              <u>
               Learn how to be a Manager
              </u>
              : Secretaries and research assistants are
just a few of the people you need to learn to manage. The secrets are few:
respect and communication. Respect is shown, for example, by asking their
schedule when you propose work, and by always saying, "Thank you." In
addition, if they have expertise in a job, only give advice on how to do it if
they ask.
             </p>
             <p>
              Most attempts at communication are not completely successful. (In the
classroom this problem is reflected in my maxim: "I can teach faster than
they can learn.") Thus, the golden rule of communication is "Say unto
others what you believe others have said unto you." After giving your
instructions, always ask your RA to explain what she thought you asked her to
do. (Do this in a way that makes it clear you consider yourself at fault for
any miscommunication. Perhaps: "I didn't explain that very well. Can you
tell me what you are planning to do?") If they don't repeat back to me
their understanding of my instructions, then it is unlikely the job will be
accomplished as I expect.
             </p>
             <p>
              <u>
               Budget your research time
              </u>
              : In economics research begun in year t
usually leads to a first draft in year t+1 or t+2. Circulating it and
presenting it at a seminar or two brings us to year t+3. Submit it to a journal
and they will (if you are lucky) ask for a revision in year t+4, which you
might complete that year. If so, they could accept it as fast as year t+5, but
it might not come out till year t+6. On the one hand, many papers can move from
conception to publication in less than six years; on the other hand, many
papers take more.
             </p>
             <p>
              Count back from the time you need to submit your tenure file. If you are
three years away and your case is less than 100% solid, don't begin any new
research! At this point your priority must be to move working papers and papers
with requested revisions into the Accepted pile.

              Presenting Your Results
             </h2>
             <p>
              Authors must work hard to make their results easy to follow. Thus, tables
must be comprehensible by themselves. That is, a reader should be able to
understand a table without reference to the text (and preferably without
reference to other tables). The converse rule is that the text should stand by
itself, even if a reader ignores the tables.
             </p>
             <p>
              <u>
               Variable names
              </u>
              should be self-explanatory. The text should flow
without ever showing that the reader has encountered a variable name. For
example, "Each plant visit by a social scientist corresponded to 3.1%
higher voluntary turnover per month (SE = .9%, P &lt; .05)" is much better
than "The coefficient of SCISTUD on VOLTUR was .031 (.009)," which is
better than "S and V were significantly related." In short, nobody
should know what passed between you and your computer in the middle of the
night. Name your dummy variable
              <i>
               Male
              </i>
              <u>
               or
              </u>
              <i>
               Female
              </i>
              , but not
              <i>
               Sex
              </i>
              .
             </p>
             <p>
              Often variables are proxies for conceptual variables. If you want to measure
complexity, but your variable is log(employment), name the variable
              <i>
               employment
              </i>
              (if all variables are expressed in logs) or
              <i>
               log(employment)
              </i>
              , not
              <i>
               complexity
              </i>
              .
             </p>
             <p>
              <u>
               Each table
              </u>
              has number and a meaningful title: "Wages Do Not Rise
with Tenure," not "Wages."
             </p>
             <p>
              All statistical tests include the name of the test, the test statistic, and
the significance level. Include a brief description of complex procedures at
the bottom of the table. Remind readers of the meaning of complicated
variables.
             </p>
             <p>
              <u>
               Each estimated equation
              </u>
              lists the dependent variable and sample size.
If one of these is constant for an entire table, list it only once. Always
include measures of goodness of fit such as R² or log-likelihood. Usually
include a test of the significance of the entire regression (such as an F test
for ordinary least squares), and appropriate residual diagnostics (such as
Durbin-Watson statistics and heteroskedasticity tests).
             </p>
             <p>
              <u>
               Coefficients
              </u>
              should include standard errors or t statistics, and some
indication of statistical significance (P values or * for P &lt; .05,
** for P &lt; .01). A note explains whether there are standard errors or t
statistics. Report P &lt; .10 only if the sample size is small.
              <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
              </span>
              For very large datasets it makes sense to
demand a higher degree of certainty, so only report P &lt; .01.
             </p>
             <p>
              Include a meaningful number of digits, usually at two or three significant
places. Neither .34849560 (3.132534) nor 0.00 (SE = 0.00, P &lt; .001) is
useful. Sometimes multiply or divide a variable by 10 so the coefficient is in
a meaningful range.
             </p>
             <p>
              Always in the text, and often in the tables, translate the coefficients of
interest into words. For example, convert logit coefficients to measure how a
one-unit change in the variable affects the probability of the occurrence of
the event (dP/dX). Translate hazard rate coefficients to show how a one unit
change in the variable affects the expected time until some event occurs:
"If the union local is in a city, its expected lifetime was four months
shorter than if it was rural."
             </p>
             <p>
              Also, always explain whether the effect is large or not, perhaps by
comparing its size to something readers understand. For example, the importance
of marital status on wages can be expressed as how many years of education are
required to raise wages by as much. Sometimes standardized coefficients
(expressed in standard deviation units) are useful: "A one month increase
in training (approximately one standard deviation) corresponds to 4 percent
lower turnover (approximately one half of a standard deviation)."
             </p>
             <p>
              Effect sizes from Lisrel, factor analysis, path analysis, ordered logits,
etc., are hard to understand. Thus, explain the size as well as the statistical
significance of the important effects.
             </p>
             <p>
              <u>
               Statistical significance
              </u>
              : Most authors focus on whether coefficients
are statistically significantly different from zero at the 5 percent
level.
              <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">

               Summary statistics
              </u>
              should be included for the referee, although they do
not always need to be in the paper. Usually include means, standard deviations,
units, sources, geographical region covered, and sample size. Usually include
summary statistics for control variables as well as for the main variables of
interest. Include the statistics for the un-logged version of any important
variables you use in log form. If your paper computes important and meaningful
intermediate results (residuals from a first-stage equation, for example),
include their summary statistics.
             </p>
             <p>
              Often give the referee a table of correlations of either the main variables
or of all the variables.
             </p>
             <p>
              Use simple statistical procedures to complement fancier analyses. Many
papers have a simple comparison of means as their main result (to be formalized
and measured more precisely in later sections). If your paper has such a
comparison at its core, then present the unadjusted means (e.g., men vs. women,
or
              <st1:country-region w:st="on">
               U.S.
              </st1:country-region>

              worthy of being in your paper can be expressed as a

condition. Restate it in words: "At the optimum, a dollar spent today must
bring the same utility as a dollar spent tomorrow, suitably discounted."

scientists are not mystery writers, abstracts also summarize the results.
Inability to write an abstract of fewer than 100 words often indicates deeper
problems with the paper.

              No research is perfect. This section presents a checklist of common
imperfections in empirical research. Discuss the limitations of your paper and
plausible alternate explanations for the results.

               Surveys
              </u>
              face problems with the match between the actual sample and
the perfect sample. Always mention the response rates and possible response
biases. Are responses likely to be sensitive to changes in the wording of the
questions? Do respondents have incentives to hide their attitudes? Are
attitudes likely to match behaviors?

              A naming issue appears when data undergo factor analysis or are summed into
an index. Do not merely name the factors or indices, but present a sample of
the questions along with the factor weights. Differentiate exploratory from
confirmatory factor analysis.

               Econometric and statistical analyses

              are subject to all the
difficulties of surveys. They also fall prey to the "textbook
chapters:" simultaneity, sample selection, measurement error, outliers,
and so forth.
              <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
              </span>
              Almost all analyses should
use methods that adjust for clustering of the sample (as in most common
datasets) and that are robust to the presence of heteroskedasticity.
              <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
              </span>
              Re-analyze the data several times to check
the specification, and make sure that your results are not sensitive to changes
in the estimating technique, functional forms, control variables, and so forth.
If all is well, allude to these results briefly, but do not include them in the
paper. Often include copies of these tables for the referee.

               Experiments
              </u>
              almost always have questionable external validity. Is
there any reason to believe people in actual organizations involved in complex
social networks making decisions that affect their careers over many years act
the way the college sophomores do in your one-hour treatment?

             <p>
              Is the name you have given your treatment appropriate? If you tell one group
of people they are not worth the wage they receive, this treatment may affect
self-esteem as well as perceived equity. Thus, naming the treated group
              <i>
               perceived
inequity
              </i>
              can mislead readers.

               Case studies

              have limited generalizability. Explain in what sense
this case study generalizes, and outline the limits of its generalizability.
What are the likely biases due to subjective perception and reporting?

               Causality
              </u>
              is almost never clear in the social sciences. Common
problems include reverse causality, selection effects, and omitted variable
bias. Discuss alternative causal explanations for the results.
              <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">

              These alternative channels often suggest
additional tests you might perform.

             <p>
              When using instrumental variables or multi-equation methods such as
two-stage least squares and maximum likelihood, always list your instruments or
other identifying assumptions. Include these lists in both the text and the
tables. Justify why it is plausible that your instruments are exogenous. Both
identification by functional form (as in many sample selection models) and
instrumenting with lagged variables require strong justification.

               Economic theory
              </u>
              : Explain the robustness of the results in
"assumption space." Differentiate assumptions that are crucial from
those that merely simplify. Even if you do not prove, explain what happens if
preferences are not Cobb-Douglas, or if agents are not identical. Usually
include detailed derivations in an appendix for the referee.

              Go for clear exposition of substance as opposed to trying to impress readers
with big words, hard statistics, or fancy theory. Present the main conclusions
so that they will be accessible to the nonspecialist reader in the final
section.

              Use footnotes sparingly, and Latin almost never. Don't rely on variable
names if you can spell them out. Remind readers often of the meaning of your
symbols: often replace “

Be sure many readers look at your article. Use family, friends, colleagues from
other departments: most of your paper should be understandable even to the nonspecialist.
