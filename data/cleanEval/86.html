       The Dan Brown code
      </h3>
      <p>
       Approximately three people still haven't read Dan Brown's
       <i>
        The
Da Vinci Code
       </i>
       :

       , and reportedly at least one other
person (as yet unidentified).*
      </p>
      <p>
       Regrettably, neither Barbara nor I are able
to claim that the third non-reader is one of us.  What can I say by
way of excuse for this?             
I found the book was on sale really cheap in CostCo when we were about to  
leave on a trip to Europe.  I bought it for the long, long flights that     
lay ahead of us, without knowing much about it except that it was supposed     
to be an intellectual mystery with cryptography and symbology and stuff
and the blurbs said it was great.  I didn't open it, I just grabbed one
off a pallet of about 500 copies.
Barbara was between mysteries at the time, so she grabbed it from me
and rapidly     
read it over the next couple of days
before we even left for the airport.  I asked hopefully what it  
was like.  She scowled and said something about the Hardy Boys.
My heart sank; I understood her to mean it was pathetic but
possibly of interest to the 11-year-old market.  By the time we were
on our plane she had made sure that
her flight bag contained a new novel by
       <a cluster="content" clusterindex="3" href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000795.html" style="background-color: rgb(234, 58, 239);">
        Menking         
Hannell
       </a>
       , and over southern Oregon she told me it was great as
usual.  Unfortunately I had no better idea of what to do with my time,
so I opened
       <i>
        The Da Vinci Code
       </i>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I am still trying to come up with a fully convincing account of just
what it was about his very first sentence, indeed the very first word,
that told me instantly that I was in for a very bad time stylistically.
      </p>
      <a cluster="none" name="more">
      </a>
      <p>
       <i>
        The Da Vinci Code
       </i>
       may well be the only novel ever written
that begins with the word
       <i>
        renowned
       </i>
       .  Here is the paragraph
with which the book opens.  The scene (says a dateline under the
chapter heading, 'Prologue') is the Louvre, late at night:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <font color="red">
         Renowned curator Jacques Saunière staggered through the vaulted    
archway of the museum's Grand Gallery.  He lunged for the nearest painting         
he could see, a Caravaggio.  Grabbing the gilded frame, the seventy-six-year-old
man heaved the masterpiece toward himself until it tore from the wall and   
Saunière collapsed backward in a heap beneath the canvas.
        </font>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I think what enabled the first word to tip me off that I was about to spend
a number of hours in the company of one of the worst prose stylists in the
history of literature was this.  Putting curriculum vitae details into complex modifiers on proper names or definite descriptions is what you do in journalistic
stories about deaths; you just don't do                   
it in describing an event in a narrative.  So this might be reasonable
text for the opening of a newspaper report the next day:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Renowned curator Jacques Saunière died last night in the Louvre
at the age of 76.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       But Brown packs such details into the first two words of an
       <b>
        action
       </b>
       sequence — details of not only his protagonist's profession 
but also his prestige in the field. It doesn't work here.
It has the ring of utter ineptitude.  The details have  
no relevance, of course, to what is being narrated (Saunière is
fleeing an attacker and pulls down the painting to trigger the alarm
system and the security gates).  We could have deduced that he would be fairly well known in the museum trade from the fact that he was
curating at the Louvre.
      </p>
      <p>
       The writing goes on in similar vein, committing style and word
choice blunders in almost every paragraph (sometimes every line).      
Look at the phrase "the seventy-six-year-old man".
It's a complete let-down: we knew he  
was a man — the anaphoric pronoun "he" had just been used to refer to him.      
(This is perhaps where "curator" could have been slipped in for the
first time, without "renowned", if the passage were rewritten.)
Look at "heaved the masterpiece toward himself until        
it tore from the wall and Saunière collapsed backward in a heap    
beneath the canvas."  We don't need to know it's a masterpiece (it's a Caravaggio hanging in the Louvre, that should be enough in the way of           
credentials, for heaven's sake).  Surely "toward him" feels better than "toward himself"                      
(though I guess both are grammatical here).  Surely "tore from the wall" should
be "tore away from the wall".  Surely a single man can't fall into a
heap (there's only him, that's not a heap).  And why repeat the name
"Saunière" here instead of the pronoun "he"?  Who else     
is around?  (Caravaggio hasn't been mentioned; "a
Caravaggio" uses the name as an attributive modifier with conventionally
elided head noun "painting".  That isn't a mention of the man.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, actually, there
       <b>
        is
       </b>
       someone else around, but we only learn that
three paragraphs down, after "a thundering iron gate" has fallen (by the
way, it's the fall that makes a thundering noise: there's no such thing
as a thundering gate).
"The curator" (his profession is now named a second time in case you missed it) 
"...crawled out from under the canvas and scanned the cavernous space
for someplace to hide" (the colloquial American "someplace" seems very             
odd here as compared with standard "somewhere").  Then:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <font color="red">
         A voice spoke, chillingly close. "Do not move."
        </font>
       </p>
       <font color="red">
        <p>
         On his hands and knees, the curator froze, turning his head slowly.
        </p>
       </font>
       <p>
        <font color="red">
         Only fifteen feet away, outside the sealed gate, the mountainous           
silhouette of his attacker stared through the iron bars.                  
He was broad and tall, with ghost-pale skin and thinning white hair.    
His irises were pink with dark red pupils.
        </font>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Just count the infelicities here.
A voice doesn't speak —a person speaks; a voice is what a person speaks
       <b>
        with
       </b>
       .
"Chillingly close" would be right in your ear, whereas this voice is         
fifteen feet away behind the thundering gate.  The curator (do we really need to be
told his profession a
       <b>
        third
       </b>
       time?) cannot slowly turn his head if he
has frozen; freezing (as a voluntary human action) means temporarily
ceasing all muscular movements.  And crucially, a silhouette
does not stare!  A silhouette is a shadow.  If Saunière can see the man's
pale skin, thinning hair, iris color, and red pupils (all at fifteen feet),
the man cannot possibly be in silhouette.
      </p>
      <p>
       Brown's writing is not just bad; it is staggeringly, clumsily,
thoughtlessly, almost ingeniously bad.  In some passages scarcely a   
word or phrase seems to have been carefully selected or compared with
alternatives.  I slogged through 454 pages of this syntactic swill, and
it never gets much better.                
Why did I keep reading?  Because London Heathrow is a long way from San Francisco International,   
and airline magazines are thin, and two-month-old Hollywood drivel on a small
screen hanging two seats in front of my row did not appeal, that's why.
And why did I keep the book instead of dropping it into a Heathrow
trash bin?  Because it seemed to me to be such a fund of lessons
in how not to write.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think I'd want to say these things about a first-time novelist,    
it would seem a cruel blow to a budding career.  But Dan Brown is all   
over the best-seller lists now.  In paperback and hardback, and in many
languages, he is a phenomenon.  He is up there with the Stephen Kings
and the John Grishams and nothing I say can conceivably harm him.  He is
a huge, blockbuster, worldwide success who can go anywhere he wants and
need never work again.  And he writes like the kind of freshman student             
who makes you want to give up the whole idea of teaching.  Never mind the ridiculous plot and the stupid anagrams and              
puzzle clues as the book proceeds, this is a terrible, terrible example of the thriller-writer's craft.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which brings us to the question of the blurbs.  "Dan Brown has to           
be one of the best, smartest, and most accomplished writers in the
country," said Nelson DeMille, a bestselling author who has himself
hit the #1 spot in the
       <i>
        New York Times
       </i>
       list.  Unbelievable
mendacity.
And there are four other similar pieces of praise on the back cover.
Together those blurbs convinced me to put this piece of garbage
on the CostCo cart
along with the the 72-pack of toilet
rolls.  Thriller writers must have a code of honor that requires
that they all praise each other's new novels, a kind of
       <i>
        omerta
       </i>
       that enjoins them to silence about the fact that some fellow member
of the guild has given evidence of
total stylistic cluelessness.  A fraternal code of silence.  We could
call it...  the Da Vinci code; or the Dan Brown code.

        The third non-reader was unknown when this post was
first drafted, but it has since been edited, and as of today (May 2, 2004)
I can confirm that Bill Poser and Danny Yee are both claiming not to have
read
        <i>
         The Da Vinci Code
        </i>
        .  Fair enough.  So at least four people
have not read it.  I just wish one of them was me.
