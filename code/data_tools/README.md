Here are some tools to assist generating and processing data: 

1. The script "select_page_from_db.py" is used to extract pages from original database and then write them into HTML files.
2. Linkclump_MOD is a modified plug-in for Chrome based on Linkclump and it is used to label pages. However, it was developed under some version long before (maybe some version in year 2015), and there is no guarantee that it can be run in the lastest version of Chrome. 
3. The script "fill_no_labeled_link.py" is used to label invisible hyperlinks with "cluster=none".
